<p>“It is of no use, Father Nat; we have gone over
the same ground again and again. I shall never
settle down as a New England farmer, and there are
other reasons why I should go forth from among you.
Mother, you have Marcus; he will stand you in good
stead: he has almost reached man’s estate, and he is
old for his years; he will be a better son to you than
I have ever been. Don’t, Loïs, my darling;” and the
speaker, a tall, handsome man of four- or five-and-twenty,
in the picturesque dress of the New England hunter,
sought to unclasp from round his neck the clinging
hands of a young girl, down whose face the tears were
flowing fast.</p>

<p>“You are my firstborn, and like Esau you are selling
your birthright, and surely even as he did you will
lose the blessing,” exclaimed his mother, wringing her
hands.</p>

<p>Martha Langlade was still a handsome woman, not
yet fifty years of age, her brow unwrinkled, no silver
thread visible in the bands of her soft brown hair,
smoothed back under a snowy cap, round which was
tied a broad black ribbon, token of her widowhood.</p>

<p>“Then even as Esau I shall be a great hunter before
the Lord,” answered her son. “I am not leaving you
comfortless, mother; you have the children and Loïs
and Marcus;” and turning towards a youth standing
beside Martha, he held out his hand to him, saying,
“Marcus, you must take my place.”</p>

<p>“I am too young, Charles; think better of it and
stay with us,” he replied.</p>

<p>The young man’s features worked; there was a
moment’s hesitation, then he shook his head, stooped
and kissed again his sister’s upturned face, and, pushing
her gently towards a grey-headed man who had
stood a silent spectator of the scene, said huskily,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Take care of her, take care of them all, Father
Nat.”</p>

<p>“A man has no right to shift his burdens upon
other men’s shoulders. You will live to rue this day,
Charles Langlade,” was the stern answer.</p>

<p>“I trust not,” said the young man; “but this I
know, go forth I must! Farewell, mother; farewell,
Father Nat; farewell, all of you. If troubles threaten
you I will come to your aid. Farewell;” and turning
away, he strode rapidly across the greensward in front
of the house, bounded over the paling, and, dashing
down the hill-side, entered the forest, and so disappeared.
As they lost sight of the tall lithe figure,
fully accoutred in his hunting garb, his blanket rolled
round him, his gun and ammunition slung across his
shoulders, Martha and the two little girls who were
clinging to her wept aloud.</p>

<p>“Don’t, mother dear,” said Loïs, throwing one arm
round Martha’s neck and kissing her.</p>

<p>“Ah, Loïs, I never thought he’d do it&#8212;never! It is
your poor father’s fault, taking the lads amongst the
heathen. I told him no good would come of it,” and
her sobs redoubled.</p>

<p>Father Nat had kept silence since his last words to
Charles Langlade; he seemed oppressed with a weight
of care. He had never really believed in the oft-threatened
desertion, and now the blow had fallen he
was for the time stunned; but he roused himself, gave
vent to a long deep sigh, then, laying his hand kindly
on Martha’s arm, said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“It’s no use fretting; what is to be will be. Come,
mother, be brave. Don’t ye grieve over much; remember
the little ones. We’ve done all we could to hold
him back. It seems almost as if the Spirit constrained
him. And ye know it is not well to fight against the
will of God.”</p>

<p>“The will of God!” exclaimed Martha angrily,
wiping her eyes and checking her sobs. “Call it rather
the machinations of the Evil One! How can you dare
say it is the will of God that a son of mine, my
eldest born, should choose to go and live amongst those
cannibals, forsaking his father’s house and taking to
himself a wife from amongst the idolaters? I never
thought to hear you say such a thing, Father Nat!
I’m minded you’ll think differently when your Roger
goes off after him.”</p>

<p>“My Roger will never do that,” said Father Nat. “I
know the two lads love each other dearly&#8212;it’s in the
blood&#8212;as I loved your husband, and as it has ever been
from generation to generation, since the first Charles
Langlade saved the life of a Roger Boscowen from the
Red Indians, and the two joining hands established
themselves together on this then waste land.”</p>

<p>“That proves what I say,” answered Martha doggedly;
“or would you sooner see our homesteads burnt and
ruin threatening us? Have you forgotten the prophecy
of the Indian woman, the first who died under the
shelter of your ancestor’s roof? ‘When Langlade
and Boscowen part, then shall the land be riven.’”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” said Nathaniel uneasily. “The lads will
love each other still, though they be parted; but Roger
will never do as Charles has done&#8212;he will never bring
my grey hairs with sorrow to the grave. He is my
only son.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut! What is to prevent him, if, as you
say of Charles, it should happen to be the ‘will
of God’?”</p>

<p>She spoke bitterly&#8212;such an unusual thing for
Martha that Father Nat looked at her with surprise,
and Loïs exclaimed,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Oh, mother! surely you do not mean it!” and the
girl’s fair face flushed and her lips quivered.</p>

<p>“I mean no harm,” said Martha; “but what more
natural? They’ve been like brothers all their lives.”</p>

<p>“But because Charles has gone astray there is no
need for Roger to do the same,” said Loïs gently. “It
was not kindly spoken, mother, and yet I know you
love Roger dearly.”</p>

<p>“Ay, surely she does,” said Nat; “who better, save
myself, and his dead mother? Come, Martha woman,
shake hands; we be too old friends to quarrel! Making
my heart sore will not heal yours.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Nat,” said Martha, bursting into tears.
“You are right, my heart is very sore. He was such
a bonnie boy; and to think I’ve lost him, for truly it
is worse than if he were dead!”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” answered Father Nat; “while there is
life there is hope. Cheer up, mother; who knows? he
may come back to us a better and a wiser man.”</p>

<p>“God grant it!” said Martha tearfully, her eyes
turning wistfully towards the dark forest, which seemed
to have swallowed up her son.</p>

<p>“You’d best come and have supper with me,
Martha,” said Father Nat. “It’s near upon eight
o’clock,” and he looked at the sky, crimson with the
glow of the setting sun. On one side lay the dark
forest, and far away the long line of hills encompassing
the valley; a broad shining river flashed like a line of
silver through the plain, where nestled the two villages
of East and West Marsh. On the slope of a hill-side
overlooking the whole country stood two houses, built
exactly alike, separated from each other originally by
a light garden fence, which in the course of years had
changed into a thick shrubbery. The “Marshwoods”
they were called, and had been so named by the first
Langlade and Boscowen who had penetrated with a
few followers across the borderland of New England,
far away from human habitations, and had struck root
on this virgin soil. No one had disputed the land
with them, save the Red Indian. Log huts had given
place in time to these two homesteads, in front of one
of which the scene we have just described had taken
place.</p>

<p>Built of the great trees hewn down in the primeval
forest, neither storm nor tempest had done them
injury. Time had rather beautified than marred their
outward seeming. The shingled roofs were thickly overgrown
with greeny yellow lichen; the woodwork of the
dormer windows, carved balconies, and deep projecting
porches had grown dark with age, thus showing off to
greater advantage the wealth of creepers which clambered
in luxurious profusion from basement to roof.
Great clusters of purple and white clematis mingled
with the crimson flowers of the dark-leaved pomegranate.
Over the porches, stretching up to the
casement windows, as if courting soft maiden hands
to gather them, clusters of white and pink roses vied
with each other in perfume and beauty.</p>

<p>Both houses were so exactly alike! The same spirit
seemed to have devised, the same hand to have carried
out the work, and yet the founders were of a different
people and a different race.</p>

<p>The Langlades were descended from a certain
Chevalier de Langlade who had fought in the great wars
under Turenne, and when the armies were disbanded
the then French Minister, Colbert, had bestowed upon
his regiment, as a reward for its services, all the lands
lying on the shores of the great Lake of St. Lawrence&#8212;“Canada,”
as the Indians called it; “New France,” the
colonists baptised it, when as far back as 1535 a French
explorer, Jacques Cartier, ascended the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>In 1608 the brave and tender-hearted Samuel
Champlain laid the foundations of the City of Quebec,
standing proudly on her rock overlooking land and sea.
France was then virtually mistress of North America,
from Hudson’s Bay to the Gulf of Mexico, by right
of precedence. Therefore these warriors, when they
landed on the shores of the St. Lawrence, felt that
they were not wholly aliens from their beloved country,
for which they had fought and bled. Ceasing to be
soldiers, they became great hunters. Most of them belonged
to the Reformed Church, and though Henry IV.
had renounced his faith to become King of France, he
so far favoured his former co-religionists as to decree
that New France was to welcome the Calvinists, and
that they were to be allowed to worship after their own
fashion; but Cardinal Richelieu, who by the Revocation
of the Edict of Nantes drove the Huguenots out of France,
thus depriving her of the most industrious of her population,
extended his spirit of intolerance even to New
France, and decreed that the Calvinistic worship was
no longer to be tolerated there. The result was that
many influential families left Canada, seeking a new
home. Amongst these was a Charles Langlade, with
the young wife he had but lately wedded. It was a
perfect exodus, for he was much beloved and had
many followers. They went south, past the great
Lake Champlain, into the dense forests of the west.
The Indians swarmed along their path, and daily,
hourly, the exiles were exposed to the danger of the
tomahawks of the savages.</p>

<p>One memorable day the French Canadians suddenly
came upon a group of Englishmen defending themselves
as best they could against an overwhelming number of
redskins. Charles Langlade fired, at what proved to be
the Indian chief, as with raised arm he was in the act
of bringing his tomahawk down on the head of a tall,
largely built man, whose rugged features and great
strength marked him out from his companions. This
man was Roger Boscowen. Their chief slain, the Indians
fled. Then Charles Langlade and Roger Boscowen, who
had thus seemingly met by chance, joined hands, and
a great and strong affection grew up between them, so
that they cast in their lots together. Roger Boscowen
had but lately landed upon the shores of New England;
he too had left his Lincolnshire fens, with other well-to-do,
God-fearing yeomen, for conscience’ sake, to find
a country where they might glorify God. They were
not “broken men,”&#8212;adventurers or criminals driven
from their fatherland by earthly want,&#8212;but men who
were constrained by their fear of God and their zeal
for godly worship.</p>

<p>They had no dreams of gold-fields, but were resolute
and industrious, quiet and stern, recognising from the
first that nothing was to be expected from the land but
by labour. So the representatives of the two races
united, and marched onward together along the wavy
line of the New England border, until they reached
a spot which seemed to possess all the most essential
qualifications for a new colony. Forest land, deep hills
and dales, pastures sloping down to a broad shining
river which watered all the land, lay stretched out before
them; and here they pitched their tents, and in time
multiplied and prospered, upholding from generation
to generation the characteristics of their Puritan and
Huguenot forefathers&#8212;namely, piety and simplicity of
life. The “Marshes” had become one of the largest
and most prosperous of the border settlements.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the Langlades and Boscowens were
alike proud of their descent, and strove ever to prove
themselves worthy in all things of those who had gone
before and were called “Fathers of the land.”</p>

<p>That an eldest son should have gone astray and have
forsaken his ancestral home was therefore a bitter
sorrow. Alpha and Omega had been added to the name
of Marshwood to distinguish the homesteads. The
Langlades owned Alpha, the Boscowens Omega. As
son succeeded father the tie which bound the heads of
the two houses together was never once broken; no
word of dissension ever arose between them. Younger
sons and daughters went forth into the busy world;
some were lost sight of, others returned from time to
time with a curious longing to see once more the home
of their race, and were made welcome and treated
hospitably; but, up to the present time, the eldest son
of either branch had never deserted his post.</p>

<p>The present generation was less fortunate in their
domestic relations than their predecessors. Nathaniel
Boscowen lost his wife when his only son Roger was
still a child, and Louis Langlade died in the prime
of life from an accident he met with while hunting.
With his dying breath he commended his wife and
children to the care of his life-long companion and
friend Nathaniel, who became forthwith “Father
Nat,” not only in the settlement, but amongst the
Indians, who came to barter the skins of wild beasts
for English goods. He was still a man in the prime
of life, and he strove nobly to fulfil his charge; but
Louis Langlade himself had early inspired his son
and Roger with a love for hunting and the wild
Indian life, and after a time Nat found it impossible
to exercise any control over Charles. He would disappear
for days together, and at last announced his
intention of dwelling entirely with the Indians and
taking a wife from amongst them.</p>

<p>Up to the very last no one believed he would really
carry out the threat, and when he did the blow, as we
have seen, fell heavily upon them all.</p>

<p>In answer to Father Nat’s invitation to supper,
Martha said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall be glad to come; at least I shall not
see his empty chair at my own table. Come, children;
we will go and see after the men’s supper, and then
betake ourselves to Omega Marsh.”</p>

<p>Marcus followed his mother, and so Nathaniel and
Loïs were left standing alone in the porch. For a time
they both kept silence; suddenly Father Nat asked,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Do you know where Roger is, Loïs? He has been
absent since dawn.”</p>

<p>“No, I do not,” she answered. “But he will come
home; have no fear, Father Nat,” and she turned her
young face towards him, bright, notwithstanding the
shadow resting on lips and brow. She was barely
eighteen, tall and slim, but with those delicately
rounded limbs which denote perfect health and
strength; her features were regular, her large grey
eyes fringed with long lashes, the tips of which curling
up caught the sunlight, even as did the rich golden
hair which, waving back behind the small ears, fell
in two long thick plaits below her waist. She, like
her mother, wore a black gown, a large white bibbed
apron, and sleeves turned back to the elbow, with
facings of linen, scarcely whiter than the rounded
arms thus exposed to view.</p>

<p>“I believe he will,” said Father Nat, in answer to
her assertion; “but he will never be content, never
be satisfied again.”</p>

<p>“We will trust he may, in time,” answered Loïs.
“Why look ahead, dear Father Nat?”</p>

<p>“You are right, lass. ‘Sufficient unto the day.’
There’s the gong for supper; come, the mother will
follow.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke Martha and her children joined
them, and together they passed through the wicket
gate which alone separated the two gardens.</p>

<p>The meal was, according to the good old custom,
taken in common, masters and servants sitting at the
same board. When the master entered the great
kitchen, some ten or twelve men and women employed
on the home farm were standing about in groups
awaiting Nat’s appearance, and naturally discussing
the great event of the day. Doffing his broad
wideawake, he bade them “Good-evening,” as did
also Martha and her children. The salutation was
heartily returned, and then he took his place at the
head of the long table, upon which great joints of cold
viands and huge pasties were already exciting the
appetites of those about to partake thereof. When
they were all gathered round the board, Father Nat
raised his hand to enforce silence, and in a solemn
voice called upon God to bless the fruits of the earth.
When he had finished his prayer, before uttering the
usual “Amen” he paused; evidently some strong
emotion checked his power of speech, but all present
felt he had something more to say, and waited
respectfully.</p>

<p>“My friends,” he said at last, with a slight quiver
in his manly voice, “you all know that one we love
has gone out from amongst us, to our great sorrow. I
commend him to your prayers. May the God of his
fathers watch over him, and guide his footsteps in the
right way. Amen.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” repeated all present, and then they seated
themselves and the meal began, but not gaily as usual,
the cloud which rested on the master overshadowing
them all.</p>

</h2>


<p>The sun was setting, and the rays of crimson light
tinged the topmost branches of the forest trees,
but scarcely could be said to penetrate through the
closely interlaced branches. The long grass and thick
undergrowth made walking difficult, whilst the tightly
entwined boughs of the trees formed a thick, leafy
canopy, perfectly impenetrable, added to which parasitic
plants twined up the huge trunks in luxuriant
wildness.</p>

<p>After he had, so to speak, fled from his home
and his people, Charles Langlade walked straight
before him through the forest. He was a handsome
man, his mouth firm set, his nose rather large, and his
chin prominent, cleft in the middle. His eyes were
grey, like those of his sister Loïs, and his eyebrows
marked. He wore, what was unusual among the hunters,
his hair rather long. Altogether his appearance was
remarkable; there was something about him which
reminded one of the heroes of old, knights and
crusaders. Suddenly he stopped, and passed his hand
across his brow as if trying to remember.</p>

<p>“It has unnerved me,” he said aloud. “I shall lose
my way if I don’t take care.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he stretched out his hand, and, passing
it lightly over the trunk of the nearest tree, knew
instantly by the feel of the bark the direction he was
in, whether north or south, east or west. Satisfied, he
strode forward, stopping from time to time to make
sure he was on the right track.</p>

<p>This following a trail is perfectly simple to the
Indian and the Canadian hunter. They read every
mark and sign in the wood as clearly as if they were
written; the moss, the lichen, tell their tale. No
foot-print, however light, can escape their notice; they
know whether it be a white or red man’s foot, whether
it be of to-day or yesterday.</p>

<p>It was thus with Charles Langlade. He walked
unhesitatingly through the darkness, until suddenly
the forest came to an end, and he found himself
standing on an elevated plain overgrown with a sort
of heather, sloping gradually down to a river which
flowed at its base. The moon had risen and was shining
with a clear light over the country, making visible the
long line of distant hills and the silvery stream, running
low down through the land. He waited a few seconds
considering; then he gave a long, low whistle. Immediately
he was answered in the same way, and at some
little distance a figure rose from out of a clump of
bushes and advanced quickly towards him.</p>

<p>The individual was a man taller even than Charles,
and in every way of larger build, his clothes being of
the same fashion. The two men clasped hands when
they met, and Charles said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“I’ve kept you waiting, old fellow.”</p>

<p>“You’ve had a bad time of it, I expect,” said Roger
Boscowen. “Is it really over, and for good?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” answered Charles, “and none too
soon. I nearly gave in when Loïs put her arms round
my neck and entreated me to remain. I should not
care to go through that ordeal every day,” and he
heaved a sigh. Even whilst speaking they had both
unfastened the skins and blankets they carried, and,
throwing them on the ground, lay down full length
and rolled themselves in them.</p>

<p>“The chiefs will not be here till dawn,” said Charles;
“we shall have a long last night together, friend.”</p>

<p>“Not long enough for all we have to say to each
other,” answered Roger sadly.</p>

<p>Charles Langlade turned his face towards him and
stretched out his hand; Roger laid his in it, and with
only the pale light of the moon and stars shining
down upon them, they looked steadily into each other’s
eyes. Two finer specimens of early manhood it would
have been difficult to find; they both came of races
who for generations had lived sober, healthy lives,
fearing God, and, as far as in them lay, keeping His
commandments.</p>

<p>Living hard lives, and frequently sleeping out in
the open air, had made these two young men vigorous
and powerful beyond even what might have been
expected.</p>

<p>After a somewhat lengthened silence, Charles said
gently,&#8212;</p>

<p>“We shall remain friends, Roger, for ever and for
ever; my going will make no difference between
<i>us</i>?”</p>

<p>“How can you imagine that should be possible?”
answered Roger sombrely. “You are going where I
neither can nor will follow you. When the sun rises
to-morrow morning we shall bid each other farewell;
you will go your way, I shall go mine, and in all
probability we shall not meet again, except it be as
enemies in the fray.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope not that,” answered Charles, with a
touch of sadness in his voice; “and yet it is this
pending conflict which must break out before long
which has in a great measure constrained me to
take my present step. I cannot bear arms against
France; I hold they have the right of precedence
in Canada.”</p>

<p>“What is that to you ?” said Roger harshly. “You
have been born under British rule; if need be, it is
your duty to fight for England, to protect your
home against the invader. That is all we ask you
to do.”</p>

<p>Charles Langlade shook his head.</p>

<p>“You know as well as I do, Roger, that before long
there will be a great and mighty struggle between
France and England; it is no fault of mine, but I
honestly tell you that all my instincts, all my feelings,
are with the Canadians. I believe they will defend the
colony to their very uttermost; and if only France send
them help, they will probably be successful.”</p>

<p>“Why then do you not join the Canadians
openly, instead of allying yourself to the Indians
who are devoted to the French interests?” said
Roger.</p>

<p>“Because I will not give up my liberty,” answered
Charles. “By remaining with the Indians, and becoming
probably in time a chief amongst them, I am free.
I trust to attain great influence in their councils, and
perhaps prevent much cruelty. If I offered myself for
service to the present Government of Canada, I should
have to wink at much of which I disapprove. Peculation
and robbery are the order of the day. Vaudreuil is a
fool, and Bigot, his Controller of Finance, a knave. No,
thank you; I prefer my savage chiefs to such civilised
rascals. You know I went to both Quebec and Montreal
to see for myself how matters stood, and I came away
disgusted. If France loses Canada, it will be through
the incapacity of the men she has placed at the
helm.”</p>

<p>“And you will marry Ominipeg’s daughter?” said
Roger.</p>

<p>“Yes, such is my intention,” answered Charles.
“The Indian maiden is gentle and possessed of all
good instincts, and she loves me. She will become a
Christian, and I shall wed her. She knows no will but
mine; surely she will make me happier than any other
girl, who might worry me with her humours. I know
all you have to say against it&#8212;the fate of the children
who may be born to me; but that is a matter for after
consideration.”</p>

<p>“I have done,” said Roger, and he threw himself
back on the ground with a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>“Nay, but, Roger, we shall not be wholly parted;
you will come out to my wigwam in the hunting
season, and we shall be together. You are no stranger
to the tribe I am about to join; you will be always
welcome.”</p>

<p>“Not if war break out and we are on opposite sides,”
said Roger.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Charles; “I have something to tell
you, which I will confide only to you,” and drawing
closer still he whispered into Roger’s ear, and for a
time they conversed in low voices together.</p>

<p>“Wrong can never be right,” said the latter at last.
“The Indians are a treacherous race. If you offend
them, mark my word, they will be revenged. Now let
us sleep; it will soon be morning;” and side by side,
with their hands clasped in each other’s, as they were
wont to lie when boys, they fell asleep.</p>

<p>The day was just dawning, and the soft hazy light
of early morn was creeping over the land, when suddenly
and simultaneously they awoke. They cast one
questioning look at each other, and sprang to their
feet.</p>

<p>Paddling slowly down the river which ran below were
some fifty canoes, filled with Indians in their most
gorgeous array, uttering, as they moved slowly on, loud
cries of delight, and gesticulating wildly.</p>

<p>“They have come for me,” said Charles, his voice
quivering with the multitude of his emotions.</p>

<p>Do we ever take a decisive step in life without a
momentary hesitation&#8212;a backward glance of regret at
the past we are leaving behind, and an instinctive fear
of the unknown future?</p>

<p>Roger saw it, and a wild hope flashed through his
heart. “There is yet time to hold back!” he said, in
a low, eager voice, laying his hand on his friend’s arm,
as if to detain him.</p>

<p>“Nay,” answered Charles, throwing back his head.
“I have passed my word and I will not now draw back.
Farewell.” He wrung Roger’s hand; then, drawing
himself up to his full height, he repeated the Indians’
cry, and, bounding down the slope, stood at the river’s
edge in full view of the canoes, which stopped paddling,
the Indians in them showing signs of satisfaction at the
sight of their new ally.</p>

<p>Two canoes came close up to the bank. In the first
stood a chief, more gorgeously arrayed than his fellows,
with ceremonial paint, scalp locks, eagle plumes, and
armed with steel hatchet and stone war-club. He
stretched out his hand to Charles, who immediately
entered his canoe, renewed shouts from the Indians
making him welcome.</p>

<p>And Roger, standing where his friend had left him,
with his arms folded, saw Charles, as he stood beside
the chief, look up at him and wave his cap in token of
farewell, as his frail bark, taking the lead, was paddled
down the stream, the others following in compact order.</p>

<p>Roger never moved until the last of the crews
had disappeared and silence had once more fallen on
the land; then he threw himself down on the spot
where they had passed the night together, and, strong,
brave man though he was, wept bitterly for the friend
who had departed from him.</p>

</h2>


<p>“Well, Loïs, I think it’s pretty nearly time Roger
was back amongst us; he’s been gone over two
months,” said Father Nat, standing beside Loïs, as she
sat on the broad window-seat, a large basket of household
linen beside her, which she was carefully sorting
and arranging. She and her mother managed Father
Nat’s household matters as well as their own, whilst
he looked after the outdoor work of the two farms.
Virtually they really formed but one community: all
their interests were in common; but they maintained
their separate establishments. Nokomis, a coloured
woman, ruled in the kitchen of Omega Marsh, and in
her department suffered no interference; but the linen
was Loïs’ care: twice every week she spent the whole
day putting it in order. When Father Nat made the
above remark, she paused in what she was doing and
said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Two months, Father Nat! It is ten weeks since
he started for Oswega.”</p>

<p>“Ten weeks, is it?” answered Nat. “He ought to
be back, Loïs;” and turning away from her, he looked
steadily out of the window.</p>

<p>“Yes, he ought,” she answered; “I understood he
had left Oswega a month ago?”</p>

<p>“So he did,” answered Nat; “he went with some
other traders to Miamis, you know&#8212;the village of Old
Britain.”</p>

<p>“He’s safe there,” said Loïs. “I thought you always
said Old Britain was a fast friend of the English?”</p>

<p>“So he is, but the French don’t half like it; they are
always trying to get him on their side. But what with
presents and selling our goods dirt cheap, we’ve managed
somehow to keep him and his tribe satisfied; but I
expect every day to hear the French have either bought
him over or destroyed and plundered the village.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’ve heard something already,” said
Loïs, and she went and stood beside him. “What is it,
Father Nat?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>He did not answer immediately. At last, in a
hurried voice, he said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“There is a rumour, but it may be false. I don’t
want to give heed to it.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” repeated Loïs. “Tell me quickly,
Father Nat,” and in her excitement she laid her hand
on his arm.</p>

<p>“The news has come,” said Nathaniel slowly, “that
a fleet of canoes manned by two hundred and fifty
Ottawa and Ogibwa warriors have paddled down the
lakes from Green Bay and so up the Maumee, and
when last heard of they were marching through the
forests against the Miamis.</p>

<p>“This news is three weeks old. If it be true, they
will have surprised Old Britain and made short work
of him, for you know most of the men of the tribe are
away at this time for the summer hunting; only the
old men, squaws, and children remain in the village.
Roger, as I said, was going there with other traders; it
strikes me if all had gone well he would have been
home by this time.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything else?” asked Loïs, and the
very way in which she put the question was proof that
she expected something more.</p>

<p>Nathaniel hesitated.</p>

<p>“Hush, do not say it,” she said, throwing back her
head, whilst tears filled her eyes. “Charles was at
Green Bay when last we heard of him,” and she wrung
her hands.</p>

<p>“It is of no use, Loïs; we must make up our minds
to it,” said Father Nat with a sigh. “He has passed
away from us; he is gone over to the enemy, and in
the war which is threatening us his hand will be against
his own home and against his own people. I have heard
that in the two years he has dwelt amongst them he has
become a great man with the Indians; and the French
hold him also in much esteem, partly because of his
influence with the tribes, partly on account of his
knowledge of Indian warfare and his forest lore. It
is certain that an expedition did start from Green Bay
commanded by a white man; they stopped at the fort
at Detroit; but whether the white man was Charles,
and whether they pushed on as far as Old Britain’s, we
do not know.”</p>

<p>Loïs had listened in silence, with bowed head.
Suddenly she looked up, a light in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Father,” she said, “Charles would defend Roger
with his own life; he would never suffer any one to
touch a hair of his head.”</p>

<p>“If he happened to come across him! But with
two hundred devils rushing into a half-deserted village,
ten chances to one they would never meet; they would
have scalped him before Charles came up. Besides, he
could not restrain them. I know too well what Indians
are like when they have once tasted blood. And to
think that a Langlade should consort with such devils!
There is little doubt, Loïs, if Old Britain has been
attacked, and Roger happened to be there, as I am
pretty sure he was, I shall never see my son again,&#8212;and
he is my only son!”</p>

<p>“Father, I am here.”</p>

<p>Nathaniel and Loïs turned sharply round, the latter
with a faint cry, and there, leaning against the wall close
by the door, stood Roger. He could move no farther.
His clothes were torn almost to rags, one arm was in
a sling, his head was bandaged, his face colourless; but
worse than all was the look of despair in his eyes.
Loïs crossed the room rapidly, and, pushing a chair
towards him, said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Sit down, Roger.”</p>

<p>Mechanically he obeyed, and from his parched lips
came in a hard guttural voice the one word, “Water.”</p>

<p>Loïs hastened away, and Nathaniel, laying his hand
on his son’s shoulder, said with ill-disguised emotion,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Thank God you’re back, lad; but you’ve had a hard
time of it.”</p>

<p>Roger made no answer; he merely bowed his head,
and, taking from Loïs the bowl she now offered him,
drained it at one draught.</p>

<p>“Fetch your mother,” said Nat, and once more the
girl disappeared. “Now, Roger, cheer up, lad,” he
continued. “When Martha has looked at your wounds,
go straight away upstairs and sleep it off. Don’t try
to tell us anything at present. I guess pretty well
what has happened. It’s been rough work; but you’ve
escaped with your life, and that’s more than I expected.
Will you eat something?”</p>

<p>Roger shook his head, and rising to his feet he
almost wailed forth,&#8212;</p>

<p>“He was my friend&#8212;my own familiar friend!”</p>

<p>It was terrible to see the agony in his face. Physical
pain is as nothing compared with the wrench of the
heart’s strings. Roger had gone away a young man;
he came back with heavy lines across his brow, and a
drawn, hard look about his mouth.</p>

<p>Martha now came in, followed by Loïs.</p>

<p>“There, don’t ye fret, Roger,” she said; “the thing’s
done, and there’s no mending of it. Sit ye down, and
let me see what ails your head and arm. I’d like to
think it were none of his doing?”</p>

<p>Martha uttered the last words wistfully, almost
questioningly; but Roger made no answer, and a deep
sigh escaped her as she proceeded to unbandage his
head. He was as docile as a little child under her hands.</p>

<p>“Get plenty of water and linen, Loïs, and be quick
about it,” said Martha sharply; “and you, Nat, just
hand me those scissors.” As they both turned away
to obey her she bent over Roger, and whispered in a
quivering voice, “It can’t hurt you as it hurts me,
his mother.”</p>

<p>“He saved my life,” said Roger.</p>

<p>“Thank God for that,” answered Martha; and turning
round, she added, “Do you hear, Father Nat? My
poor boy saved Roger’s life,” and great tears ran down
her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I said he would!” came from Loïs, who returned
with basin and ewer just as her mother uttered the
last words.</p>

<p>“But I’d rather have died than have seen him as
he now is,” said Roger.</p>

<p>“Nay, lad,” returned Nat; “your dying would not
have given him back to us: it would but have made
our hearts the sorer. Live to prove yourself the better
man. Now be quick, Martha; the sooner he’s in bed
the better.”</p>

<p>The wound on Roger’s head was both deep and painful;
it had been caused by a blow from a steel hatchet&#8212;how
it had not killed him was the marvel. His arm had a
deep flesh wound. But what ailed him most was the
great moral depression. He had evidently received a
shock, from which he had not been able as yet to
recover. Loïs as she helped her mother watched him
closely, but she kept silent, knowing the sorrow was
still too fresh to allow of comfort. When the dressing
was over and he had drunk another bowl of fresh
water, he rose, saying,&#8212;</p>

<p>“I will follow your advice, father, and go to bed.
Call me at suppertime.”</p>

<p>And without uttering another word, looking neither to
the right hand nor to the left, he quitted the kitchen.
They heard him go slowly up the stairs, and, crossing the
floor of the room overhead, fall heavily upon his bed.</p>

<p>Father Nat gave a deep groan, and Martha, sinking
on a settle, threw her apron over her head and sobbed
bitterly.</p>

<p>Loïs, kneeling down beside her mother, laid her
head on her shoulder. No one spoke; they were
realising for the first time how great the barrier must
needs be which had arisen between them and Charles
Langlade, the Indian chief.</p>

<p>“I’d sooner have seen him lying dead before me,”
moaned Martha.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, Martha, say not so; life is life&#8212;there is
no hope in the grave! Remember David, who ‘fasted
and wept while the child was yet alive’ in the hope
that ‘God might be gracious and that the child might
live, but after he was dead he ceased all outward signs
of mourning and bowed his head and worshipped God.’
Is it nothing that we can still pray the Father to bring
our dear one home to us again?”</p>

<p>Father Nat’s voice was full of deep emotion, and
taking up his hat he too went forth.</p>

</h2>


<p>Supper was over; the men and women employed
about the house and home farm had dispersed.
Father Nat sat in his large wooden armchair within
the great fireplace, his pipe between his teeth; but it
had gone out, and in his preoccupation he had not
noticed the fact. Opposite him sat Martha Langlade
knitting, and the click of her needles was heard above
the murmuring voices of the two younger girls, who
were busy conning over their lessons for the morrow.
In marked distinction to the Canadians, and French
colonies, education was held in high esteem, and indeed
enforced, in the New England states. Whenever a
settlement mustered a sufficiently large population to
be able to support a minister, there, beside the church
or chapel, a schoolhouse was sure to spring up, the
functions of minister and schoolmaster being generally
united in the same person. In the broad window-seat
Loïs was telling Marcus the particulars of Roger’s
return. The young man was now nearly twenty.
Physically he resembled his brother, but in character
he was the very opposite. Warfare was hateful to him;
had he lived in quiet times he would have been a
student. John Cleveland, the minister of the Marshes,
had earnestly desired that he should be brought up to
the ministry; but when his elder brother left them,
Marcus knew that his place was at home, that his
mother and sisters needed him, and quietly, without
a murmur, he had put his own wishes on one side, and
applied himself to the management of the farm. He
was not brilliant like either Roger or Charles, but he
was doggedly industrious, and Father Nat seldom had
reason to complain. He was also a good son, and
Martha, though she often grumbled at what she termed
his slowness, knew it well; but he was not her firstborn,
and he was fully aware that, labour as he might, he
never succeeded in filling the vacant place in his
mother’s heart; he never could replace the eldest son
after whom she yearned! Loïs and he were great
friends; they had always been so, trusting and supporting
each other in all things.</p>

<p>“He’s slept over eight hours,” said Father Nat at
last.</p>

<p>Loïs turned round, listened for a moment, then
said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“He’s moving now; he’ll surely be wanting some food.
I’ll go and see to it;” and rising she went into the
outer kitchen, listening all the time for his step on the
stairs as she and Nokomis prepared the supper. At
last it came, not firm and quick as usual, but slow and
heavy, as if the soul of the man were also heavy within
him.</p>

<p>“Give me the scones, Nokomis,” said Loïs; and,
taking the dish, she entered the front kitchen by one
door as Roger came in by the other.</p>

<p>“You’ve had a good sleep and must need your
supper,” she said with a smile. “Nokomis has kept
some scones hot for you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he answered, and then lifting his eyes
he looked round the room. Marcus held out his
hand.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re back, Roger,” he said, “but
desperately sorry for the cause which kept you
away.”</p>

<p>“I knew you would be,” answered Roger, as he
seated himself at the table, where one of the younger
girls had hastened to spread a snowy cloth, upon which
Loïs placed the food.</p>

<p>“Are your wounds easier, Roger?” asked Martha.</p>

<p>“I scarcely feel my arm, but my head aches badly,”
he answered.</p>

<p>“You want food; you’ll be better after supper,” said
his father.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” answered Roger carelessly, and he took
up his knife and fork and began mechanically to eat
the food Loïs put upon his plate. But after the first
few mouthfuls, nature asserted her rights. He was
young and strong, had fasted all that day, and the
fever of his wounds having left him, his appetite
returned, and Loïs had the satisfaction of seeing the
food disappear.</p>

<p>With infinite tact she told him of little events which
had taken place in the settlement during his absence.
Father Nat, Marcus, and the others joined in, so that
the conversation became general. Roger kept silence,
but he was evidently listening. Suddenly the door
opened, and John Cleveland, the minister, entered. He
and Nathaniel had been friends ever since he had been
elected minister of the Marsh villages. The young
Langlades and Boscowens had had no other teacher;
he had married a Boscowen, a cousin of the present
head of the house, and was therefore one of the
family.</p>

<p>Every evening, summer and winter alike, he smoked
his pipe in the chimney corner of Omega Marsh.
Roger Boscowen and Charles Langlade had been great
favourites with him, and both the young men returned
his affection. He had done his best to prevent the
latter taking the fatal step which had plunged them all
into sorrow; failing to do so, he had grieved for him
almost as bitterly as Nat had done.</p>

<p>Whilst Roger was sleeping, his father had gone over
to the minister’s house and told him of the boys’
return.</p>

<p>“But I don’t like the look in his eyes,” he
had said; “the meeting with Charles, under present
circumstances, has unhinged him terribly. It’s not
the fighting, nor the wounds; it’s the moral shock. I
don’t think he ever really realised the change before.
You’ll see what you think of him when you come up
to-night.”</p>

<p>Entering the kitchen, John Cleveland went straight
up to Roger, and laying his hand on his shoulder said
earnestly,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Thank God you’re home again! Your father and
I have been in trouble about you, Roger. You’ve had a
hard time of it, lad. But it’s well, perhaps, you should
look things straight in the face; you know now for
certain that he we loved so well is lost to us, unless
God in His great goodness vouchsafes to bring him
home. In the meantime you are our hope and stay,
Roger. Your name is in every mouth throughout the
towns and villages of New England, as the man most
capable of defending us against the French and Indians.
The vote has been given; you are to be elected Captain
of the Rangers, because of your superior knowledge in
woodcraft. Within the last few days the story of Old
Britain’s massacre has spread terror everywhere. There
are those who still remember the massacre of Haverhill,
when their minister was beaten to death and the
men, women, and children murdered in cold blood,
upwards of forty years ago. I am a man of peace and
I preach peace; but if the heathen assail us, we must
arise and defend ourselves: we cannot see our wives
and children massacred or led captives before our eyes.
Therefore I say to you, Roger Boscowen, Arise and
gird on your sword, for it is a righteous cause you are
called upon to defend. All the young men of New
England and along the border are prepared to obey
you as their leader, and to aid you in the defence of
our hearths and homes. Let not your heart faint
within you,” he continued kindly, lowering his voice,
“because he you loved has gone over to the enemy.
Jonathan and David fought not in the same camp,
yet they loved each other to the end. If you cannot
tear out the brotherly affection which has grown with
your growth and has been so sweet to you, make up
your mind to sacrifice it at the call of duty.”</p>

<p>He ceased, and there was a moment’s silence; then
Roger arose, and standing in the midst of them
said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“You are right, Mr. Cleveland, and I thank you for
putting into words the struggle which has been going
on within me. But it is over. From henceforth he
and I are strangers one to another.”</p>

<p>He paused, drew a long breath, and then, as if he
had cast something far away from him, crossed over to
where his father sat, and, taking the seat beside him,
said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Now, if you will let me, I will tell you all that has
happened since I left home: it is a long and painful
story.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes all those present had gathered
round him. Martha laid her knitting down and folded
her hands to listen. It was of her son, her firstborn,
she was about to hear, and it seemed to her as if her
heart were like to break.</p>

<p>When they were all settled Roger began. “I found
upon reaching Oswega that trade was far from flourishing.
The French are growing very aggressive, and are daily
becoming better friends with the Indians; they are
liberal with both presents and promises, whereas we are
neither; indeed, the Indians accuse us of not keeping
faith with them. I and a dozen other traders decided
therefore to go and see what we could do with Old
Britain and the Miamis. It was the end of May when
we reached the village. Most of the Indians were away
on their summer hunt; but Old Britain received us well,
and persuaded us to remain till some of the tribe should
return. Thinking this might prove advantageous, as
they were sure to bring fresh skins with them, we
agreed to do so. Everything went well for the first
fortnight; then we heard rumours of raids farther up
the country, and I saw Old Britain was anxious. Once
or twice he sent men out as scouts; but they came
back saying they had seen no enemy, that the land
was quiet; so, though he took every precaution against
being surprised, he was satisfied there was no immediate
danger to fear. He was not made aware by any sign
that on the night of June 20th the enemy slept quietly
in the near forest. They had come down the lakes in
a fleet of canoes, two hundred and fifty picked warriors of
the Ottawa and Ogibwa tribes. Silently, as only Indians
can march, they made their way through the forest.
At daybreak we were aroused by the shrill cry we all
know so well, and then they were upon us, spreading
terror through the village. The rifle rang out, the cry
of the dying arose. Old Britain and his Indians fought
bravely; but of course from the first it was hopeless&#8212;numbers
were against them. They were slain or taken
prisoners every one of them: it was a hideous spectacle.
We traders had taken refuge in the warehouse, where
till five in the afternoon we defended ourselves against
fearful odds. Early in the day I had seen and recognised
their chief. No need for me to tell you who he
was! Three of our men managed to get out, hoping
to reach the forest and escape: they failed, and were
massacred before our eyes. Then the Indians swarmed
over the palisades into the warehouse, and we knew that
our last hour had come; but foremost, trying to hold
them in check, came their chief. When he saw me he
sprang wildly forward, covering me with his own body.
‘For God’s sake surrender!’ he said. ‘Never!’ I
answered, and fired over his head. An Indian fell; it
was a signal for all the others to rush on. <i>He</i> turned
upon me. I never shall forget the look in his face. I
saw the glittering steel in his hand as he threw the
whole weight of his body upon me and struck me
down.</p>

<p>“When I recovered consciousness I found myself in
a log hut in the middle of the forest, <i>he</i> standing
over me bathing my head.</p>

<p>“‘I couldn’t help it, old fellow,’ he said. ‘It was the
only way of saving your life.’”</p>

<p>Roger paused. His voice failed him, so deep was
his emotion; but when he spoke again he had mastered
himself.</p>

<p>“I stayed in that hut a whole week unable to move;
he kept guard over me and nursed me night and
day. At the end of that time I was fit to travel. He
brought me on my way until I was out of danger; then
we parted. Ask me not what we said one to the other
during those days and nights we were alone together;
from henceforth we have agreed to strive our very
uttermost never to meet again, never to look into each
other’s faces. We are dead to one another. He told
me that not for worlds would he again go through
the agony he endured when he felled me to the earth,
and stood over my body to prevent his Indians scalping
me. Was I dead or alive? Had the curse of Cain
descended upon him? He had conquered me; I was
his captive,&#8212;that was all he knew, and by that right
he saved me from the Indians. Not till night had
fallen and they were deep in their disgusting orgies
did he and John Stone, the lad who followed him as
his servant, venture to do more than thrust me into an
outhouse, lock the door, and threaten vengeance upon
any one who should molest me. I was his prize and
he was chief! They dared not disobey. During the
night he and John carried me to a deserted hut in the
forest, where I was comparatively safe. It is a week
since we parted company. I have travelled slowly,
from weakness, and because I was only able to carry
a small amount of food. More than once I thought I
must lie down and die after he left me.”</p>

<p>Roger stopped short. “That is all,” he said, looking
round. The womenkind were weeping, the men’s faces
were stern. Then John Cleveland stood up.</p>

<p>“Let us pray,” he said; and, after the fashion
of the old Puritans, they all arose and stood with
clasped hands and bowed heads whilst the minister
prayed.</p>

<p>“O Lord, we thank Thee for Thy great mercy in
delivering our dear brother from the jaws of the lion
and bringing him back amongst us. In Thy great
wisdom Thou hast done this thing, that he may be as
Moses of old, a deliverer of Thy people. Strengthen
him, O Lord; enlighten him, that he may overcome
in Thy might the heathen and the oppressor. Give
us peace, O Lord, we pray Thee; but if because
of the wickedness in the land war cometh upon us,
then give us the victory. Teach Thou ‘our hands to
war’ that we may glorify Thy Name, and that the
strange nations may do likewise. And over this household
we pray Thee stretch forth Thine hand. Be
merciful to the widow and fatherless in their affliction,
and in Thy good time bring back the wandering sheep
into the fold. Enable us to cast out all affections
which tend not to Thy glory, and to worship Thee
alone, the only true God, for Thy Son Jesus Christ’s
sake. Amen.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” answered the little congregation.</p>

<p>“Peace be with you all,” said the minister, stretching
forth his hand.</p>

<p>And so, without further speech, but with silent hand-clasping,
they parted for the night. When all were
gone, and Father Nat and Roger stood alone on the
hearth, the former said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“It will be war, Roger.”</p>

<p>“Ay, father; it will be a terrible war,” he
answered. “Brother against brother. How shall I
endure?”</p>

<p>“The Lord’s will be done. He will surely give you
strength. Now let us go to rest, my son,” said the
elder man; and, putting out the lights, father and
son went up the broad oak staircase together, the
summer moon shining in through the casement window
lighting their darkness. But their hearts were heavy
within them.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER V</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.1em'>A HERO</span>
</h2>


<p>“Grandmother, where is Canada?” and a small
dark girl of about sixteen years of age leant, as
she asked the question, over the back of a garden chair,
in which sat an old lady of nearly seventy years of age.</p>

<p>The scene was the terrace of the Château of Candiac
in Languedoc. It was evening, and the crimson light
of the setting sun illumined the whole valley, and was
reflected in the numerous windows of the Castle, until
the ancient fortress seemed almost on fire. It was the
setting of a Southern sun, which had poured down the
whole livelong day, scorching up the grass and driving
men and beasts to seek refuge in sheltered spots; no
breath of air stirred the trees, no animal had even yet
ventured abroad. A dead silence still reigned over the
landscape, as if exhausted nature were waiting patiently
for the soft and refreshing night dews to restore her
energies.</p>

<p>“Canada, Mercèdes, is at the other end of the world,
my child,” answered Madame de St. Verin. “And I
greatly fear if your father goes thither he will never
return again. It is a land of savages, where they eat
one another;” and her eyes filled with tears, and the
white bejewelled hands resting on her lap were clasped
together with nervous energy.</p>

<p>“Nay, madame,” said a younger lady, turning round,
for she had been gazing earnestly along the white road
which ran through the valley, “why terrify the children?
If their father accepts this post of danger and of honour,
surely it is more for their sakes than his own! We are
noble, but we are poor, and there are many children to
establish in the world&#8212;a serious matter as times go.”</p>

<p>“I know, my daughter,” said Madame de St. Verin
gently; “but if you have six sons and daughters, I have
only one son left to me in my old age.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, dear madame,” replied Madame de
Montcalm. “It is a hard necessity for us all; if it were
not a necessity my dear husband would assuredly not
separate himself from us, for you know how well he
loves his home.”</p>

<p>“Well said, wife!” and an arm was thrown round
her and a kiss imprinted on her forehead by a cavalier,
dusty and travel-stained.</p>

<p>“Father, dear father!” and Mercèdes clung to him.
“How did you come? We have been straining our eyes
to catch the first glimpse of you on the high road.”</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten the short cut through the
village at the back of the Château, Mercèdes? I left
my escort to come on by the high road, and myself
came across country, through the pine forest. I did
this to gain time. I have not an hour to lose. I must
leave you the day after to-morrow; for you may congratulate me, I have received my nomination as General-in-Chief
of his Majesty’s army in Canada.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” exclaimed Mercèdes.</p>

<p>“My dear husband!” said Madame de Montcalm,
holding his hand.</p>

<p>“Mother,” said the General, embracing the old lady,
from whose eyes tears fell fast.</p>

<p>“It will be a last farewell between thee and me,
my son,” she said.</p>

<p>“Nay; wherefore take this gloomy view of the situation?”
he answered. “If I remained here I should be
nominated to a regiment, and should, I hope, see some
service. It is only a change of country, with the
superior advantages of a higher position and better
chances for the future. My eldest son is to go back
with me to Versailles, to be presented to the King and
given a commission. Why, mother, I thought you
would rejoice, and hurried on to bring you the good
news. I may be absent a year&#8212;two perhaps, if the
English prove very stubborn. Who knows? I may be
Military Governor of Canada when the war is over,
and come home and fetch you all out, and you will
hold your court like a queen in the Government House
at Quebec,” and he laughed so brightly that the clouds
seemed to break and the natural fears of those who
loved him to dispel in the sunshine of his presence.</p>

<p>“You were always hopeful, Louis,” said his mother.</p>

<p>“Why should I be otherwise?” he answered. “We
have desired this appointment; and though at first I
hesitated because of the heavy responsibilities it entails,
I have come to the conclusion that I am as capable as
another, and that Canada is worth fighting for. It is a
French colony, inhabited for generations past by our
own people. It is ‘New France.’ Surely it were a
national disgrace to let it slip through our fingers.”</p>

<p>He spoke enthusiastically: all his patriotism, all
his ambition, was aroused; a fresh life was opening out
before him, and he rejoiced in the prospect.</p>

<p>Louis, Marquis de Montcalm, the new Commander-in-Chief
of Canada, was in stature rather short than
tall, but his bearing was dignified and his manners
courteous. His eyes were dark and wonderfully brilliant;
indeed, the whole expression of his face inspired
confidence and affection. He had married in early life
Mademoiselle Louise de Roulay, and the marriage had
proved a happy one. Ten children had been born to
them; but six only were living at the time of our story.</p>

<p>Throughout life, in the midst of the corrupt court of
Louis XV., the Marquis de Montcalm had remained a
good man and a true Christian, an example in all
things to the young officers and soldiers under him.
His courage and sympathetic brightness won the
hearts of all who came in contact with him, and he
was beloved, both in life and after death, as it is given
to few men to be.</p>

<p>“Where are all my other children?” he asked,
looking around, when by his words and manner he had
succeeded in calming his mother’s fears.</p>

<p>“They went to meet you; see, they are coming
through the chestnut grove, and here is Toto,” said
Madame de Montcalm, lifting up a three-year-old
child who came running along the terrace towards
them, and placing her in her husband’s arms. He
kissed the child tenderly, waited till the others came
up&#8212;two sons and two daughters&#8212;who, as soon as they
caught sight of him, ran forward with joyous welcome.
When the glad greetings were over, and they had all
calmed down, he said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Now I will go to my room and brush off some of
the dust of my journey, and then to supper. I must
see neither tears nor sad faces, remember; it is a
good thing and a great honour which has befallen me.
Come, mother,” and with exquisite gallantry he put his
mother’s arm within his own, took his wife’s hand, and,
followed by his troop of sons and daughters, entered the
Castle. In the great hall the servants, many of whom
had grown old in the family, stood ranged on either
side to welcome him, for the news of his arrival had
spread rapidly. He smiled and nodded to them with
pleasant familiarity, saying in his cheery voice, “You
may congratulate me, my friends. Your lord is
indeed nominated to high office as ‘General to his
most gracious Majesty’s army in Canada.’ Who will
go with me?”</p>

<p>A murmur of congratulation followed these words;
and instantly three men, all young, stepped out from
amongst the servitors, and, bowing low before the
marquis, the foremost one said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“We are ready to follow our gracious master to the
world’s end.”</p>

<p>“My good Estève,” said the marquis, holding out his
hand to his secretary, who carried it to his lips, “thanks
a thousand times; I should be lost without you. And
you, Joseph and Déjean! you too are willing to brave
the dangers of the sea to accompany your master?”</p>

<p>“We are, if our master will graciously accept our
services,” said Joseph, his valet.</p>

<p>“I should be indeed churlish if I refused,” said
Montcalm. “Thanks, my friends; be ready to start
to-morrow. It will be sharp work; the troops are even
now at Brest, ready to embark.” And so saying, he
passed on till he reached his own apartments and
disappeared from view.</p>

</h2>


<p>“Father, are there no convents in Canada?”
asked Mercèdes.</p>

<p>“At Quebec, my daughter, I believe the Ursuline
Convent is a very fine establishment,” said the General.
“It was founded more than a hundred years ago, in
1640, by a very rich and very beautiful woman, Madame
de Peltrie. It is a romantic story. Her home was
near Caen, in Normandy, and her husband dying soon
after her marriage, she desired to enter a nunnery; but
her father, who was old, opposed her wishes, and she
remained with him until his death. Then she sold all
her possessions, and with another lady like-minded,
Marie de l’Incarnation, set sail with a party of Jesuit
missionaries for Canada. After untold hardships they
arrived at Quebec; and there she built a convent and
opened a school for Indian children, which she dedicated
to St. Ursula.”</p>

<p>“How do you know all this, father?” asked the
young girl, as she walked beside him on the terrace
early the following morning.</p>

<p>Mercèdes was the General’s especial favourite, and
when he was at home was always with him; nevertheless,
being the third daughter, from an early age she
had been destined to a convent life. She was perfectly
happy, and looked upon her future with complacent
satisfaction; it was the fate of many highborn girls
in those days. She closely resembled her father, was
small, sallow of complexion, with dark, sparkling eyes,
full of intelligence and sweetness.</p>

<p>“I learnt the story through a Jesuit whom I met
the other day at Court,” answered her father. “He
had just returned from Canada, and when he heard
who I was, and my position, he gave me much useful
information. He is a remarkably intelligent man, and
very devoted to the interests of the colony. He has
been a missionary amongst the Indian tribe of the
Iroquois for over twenty years. He will probably
return with me. His name is Father Mathevet.”</p>

<p>“And he said the convent was a good one? Are
the nuns French?” asked Mercèdes.</p>

<p>“French Canadians mostly; but I believe he mentioned
that two or three ladies from the mother country
had joined the community within the last year.”</p>

<p>“Father, let me go.”</p>

<p>“You, Mercèdes? My child, it is impossible!”</p>

<p>“Why impossible?” she said, in a coaxing voice.
“It is settled for me to begin my novitiate at the
Augustines; why should I not go out to Canada with
you and enter the Ursulines? I should like it much
better. It would be rather amusing teaching Indian
children; and then you would not be alone.”</p>

<p>He looked down at her. The plan seemed to chime
in with his dearest wishes. The General was a man
devoted to his home and his children, and the thought
of being separated from them all, though he accepted
it as a necessity, was very painful to him. The sudden
idea of having this child, his little Mercèdes, within
reach, to whom he might speak of the dear absent ones,
who in all things would sympathise with and understand
him, was such an unexpected joy.</p>

<p>“Do you really mean it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“If I did not, should I propose it?” she answered.
“You know I am of small account in the house, as it
has always been settled I should be a nun; whether I
am here or in Canada it can make no difference. I do
not belong to the world, but to God; you and my
mother gave me to Him when I was an infant; and
think how happy I shall be if, whilst fulfilling my
vocation, I can be a comfort to you, my dearest father,”
and she clung to his arm.</p>

<p>“That you would most assuredly be,” he said; “the
very fact of having you near me would be a comfort.
But shall you not be afraid to go so far&#8212;to cross the
sea, Mercèdes?”</p>

<p>She laughed such a bright, happy laugh. “Afraid
of what?” she said. “Is not God with us always on
sea or on land? And your daughter! Shall I dare to
be afraid?”</p>

<p>Her father smiled. “Brave heart!” he said; “truly
I do not see why you should not have your wish. A
convent in France or in Canada, it cannot make much
difference&#8212;except to me,” he added, and, stooping, he
kissed the young, eager face.</p>

<p>“You will speak to mother then?” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered thoughtfully. “If only I knew
of some woman going out to Canada!”</p>

<p>“I know some one who would gladly go,” said
Mercèdes.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked the General.</p>

<p>“My foster-mother, Marthe Dervieu. You know
her husband is dead, and all her children; she is quite
alone, and loves no one in the world as she loves me.
Only last week she told me that when I entered the
Augustines, she should go there also as serving sister.”</p>

<p>“That would indeed be just the thing; she is of
a good age, neither too young nor too old. Why,
Mercèdes, everything seems to combine to carry out
your wishes,” said her father.</p>

<p>“Marthe is just thirty-five; she was only nineteen
when she nursed me,” answered Mercèdes. “She will
be so glad to go away from here, where she has had so
much sorrow. Here comes my mother; I will leave
you with her, my dear father. I am so happy!” and
catching up his hand, she pressed it to her lips, and
then ran lightly down the steps leading from the terrace
into the Château gardens.</p>

<p>That evening, after supper, it was announced to the
assembled family that Mercèdes was going out to
Canada to become a novice in the Convent of the
Ursulines, and that her nurse Marthe Dervieu had
agreed to accompany her. The mother’s eyes were red
with weeping, and the old grandmother, Madame de
St. Verin, held Mercèdes in her arms murmuring, “My
poor lamb!”</p>

<p>“Nay, grandmother,” said the girl, though tears
choked her own voice. “You are giving me to God;
what matters it whether it be here or there, so that I
do Him service? And my dear father needs me; he
will feel that I am near him, praying, always praying
for him; and when he is weary he will come into the
quiet cloister, and we shall speak of home and of you all.
Nay, rather rejoice that such high honour is accorded
to me. Instead of an easy life of personal devotion,
which would be mine if I stayed here, I shall teach
little Indian children to worship Christ and show them
the way to heaven. Give me your blessing, grandmother;”
and she sank on her knees before Madame
de St. Verin, who, touched by the girl’s devotion and
enthusiasm, laid her thin white hands on the dark hair,
saying,&#8212;</p>

<p>“May God bless thee, my child, and have you in
His holy keeping now and for evermore.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” said all present; and then they gathered
round Mercèdes and embraced her, and it was even as
she desired, a scene more of joy than of sorrow.</p>

<p>The following day the General left, accompanied
only by his son the Chevalier and Estève, his secretary.
He decided at the last moment that his two servants
should wait to escort Mercèdes and Marthe when the
time came for them to join him.</p>

<p>He would not allow the parting to be a sad one,
reminding his children that they were descended from
heroes, and must demean themselves accordingly.</p>

<p>The Montcalms traced their lineage back to Dieudonné
Gozon, Grand-Master of the order of St. John of
Jerusalem, who in the sixteenth century delivered the
island of Rhodes from a monstrous serpent, which had
long been the terror of the inhabitants. For this
service he was made Lieutenant-General, and continued
to distinguish himself so greatly that, when he died,
at a good old age, he was honoured and revered by all
men. His race was continued by a long line of knights
and noble gentlemen, and so the Montcalms came
to be reckoned as a race of heroes, and were proud of
their descent.</p>

<p>The present Marquis, Louis de Montcalm, General-in-Chief
of his Majesty’s army in Canada, had entered
upon his military career at the early age of fourteen,
as did also his great opponent General Wolfe. Boys
were men in those days by the force of circumstances.
At the battle of Plaisance, in 1746, Montcalm was
three times wounded, and at the combat before Exiles
twice.</p>

<p>When still very young, he had stated in a letter
to his father his idea of what his aim and object in
life ought to be. It is characteristic and worthy of
record.</p>

<p>“First, to be an honourable man, of good morals, and
a Christian.</p>

<p>“Secondly, to read in moderation, to know as much
Greek and Latin as most men of the world; also to
know the four rules of arithmetic, and something of
history, geography, and <i>belles lettres</i>, and have a certain
knowledge of the arts and sciences.</p>

<p>“Thirdly, and above all things, to be obedient,
docile, and very submissive to your orders and those
of my dear mother, and also to defer to the advice of
Monsieur Dumas.</p>

<p>“Fourthly, to fence and ride as well as my small
abilities will allow.”</p>

<p>The above-mentioned Monsieur Dumas was the
family preceptor, and he and the young heir were
somewhat antagonistic, Louis not responding as readily
as Dumas could have desired to the educational pressure
to which he would have subjected him. The tutor found
a more apt pupil in the younger brother, who is stated
to have been an infant prodigy, but died at the early
age of seven years of water on the brain, having
acquired during his short life, besides a fair knowledge
of his own maternal language, Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
geography, history sacred and profane, and various
other minor studies. Probably his early death by
no means incited his brother to follow in his steps.</p>

<p>Throughout life the Marquis de Montcalm maintained
his code of honour, and, as his ancestors had
done before him, left to his children an untarnished
name.</p>

</h2>


<p>Not till the beginning of March of the following
year did the expectant household at the Château
of Candiac receive the order for Mercèdes and her
party to set out and join her father at Rennes. He
wrote thus to his wife:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class='sc'>Dearest</span>,&#8212;The delay has been painfully trying;
the Ministers have been hard to rouse. I have obtained
money, men, and ammunition with great difficulty;
but now the worst is over. I arrived at Rennes this
morning, and shall remain here until my little Mercèdes
appears, which will not be long now. I hope we shall
be at Brest on the 21st of March, and everything will
be on board by the 26th.</p>

<p>“My son has been here since yesterday, for me to
coach him and get him a uniform made, in which he
will give thanks for his regiment at the same time
as I take my leave in my embroidered coat. Perhaps
I shall leave debts behind; I wait impatiently for the
bills. You have my will; I wish you would get it
copied, and send it to me before I sail. I have much
business on hand still. My health is good, and the
passage will be a time of rest. I shall write up to the
last moment. It is pleasant, I know, to hear particulars
of those we love, and my mother, and you, my dearest
and most beloved, will gladly read even the dullest
details of my life. I am much pleased with my second
officer in command, Chevalier Levis; he is brave and
upright, full of expedients, and a man to be trusted.
I might say the same of Chevalier Bougainville, the
third in command. My greatest difficulty is getting
sufficient troops to face such a campaign. Only twelve
hundred men will embark with me. Now farewell; I
embrace you, my dearest, my mother, and my daughters.
Love to all the family,</p>

<div style='text-align:right; margin-right:4em;'>“Your devoted husband,</div>
<div style='text-align:right'>”<span class='sc'>Louis de Montcalm</span>.”</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Poor Mercèdes! When she saw the sea and the great
ships, the troops of soldiers, and all the noise and
bustle of the port, her heart sank for a moment within
her. But she soon recovered herself, and when her
father looked at her to see what impression the
scene made upon her, she smiled and said quite
quietly,&#8212;</p>

<p>“I suppose one can get accustomed to everything,
but it does seem strange after our beautiful calm
Candiac; I shall at least have seen something of the
world before I bid it farewell.”</p>

<p>“The idea of crossing the sea does not then alarm
you, my daughter?” asked the General.</p>

<p>“With God and with you, my father, what have I to
fear?” she answered.</p>

<p>It was a bright spring day, the second of April, when
they went on board. Six large vessels&#8212;large for those
days&#8212;were in the harbour; their names have come
down to us&#8212;the <i>Léopard</i>, <i>Héros</i>, <i>Illustre</i>, <i>Licorne</i>,
<i>Sauvage</i>, and <i>Sirène</i>. Very different were they from
the transport ships of to-day&#8212;devoid of every comfort,
sailing vessels, subject to wind and weather. The
General, with his officers Levis and Bougainville, and
of course Mercèdes and Marthe, took passage in the
<i>Licorne</i>; but they waited to see the troops go on board,
which they did with incredible gaiety, so much so that
Chevalier Bougainville exclaimed, “What a nation is
ours; happy is he who commands it and commands it
worthily!” And so, bravely with strong hearts, officers
and men sailed for the first time across the Atlantic,
at the command of a country which virtually forsook
them in their hour of need.</p>

<p>Poor Marthe Dervieu was very ill during the whole
voyage, but Mercèdes after the first few days recovered
from the sea-sickness, and was so well and bright that
she put the men to shame. Whenever she could leave
Marthe she came with her father on deck, thankful
to breathe the fresh sea-breeze in lieu of the dark,
stuffy cabin.</p>

<p>“We are sure to arrive safely; we have a saint on
board,” said the sailors. Nevertheless, when they
were in mid-ocean a fearful gale overtook them, which
lasted ninety hours. Many deemed their end was
near. Mercèdes, as she lay lashed into her hammock,
thought of the sunny plains of Provence, now bright
with flowers; of the dear mother and grandmother,
brothers and sisters; and it seemed to her that she
could hear their prayers above the howling of the
winds and the sound of many waters. Truly they
were terrible nights and days, never forgotten by those
who passed through them; but at last the winds and
the waves were calmed, and the travellers breathed
freely once more. Mercèdes was unlashed; but she
was so stiff that, upon trying to stand, she would
have fallen had not her father upheld and carried her
on to the deck, to see the wonderful icebergs which,
as they approached the St. Lawrence, threatened them
with destruction, and made navigation so difficult that
the ships advanced but slowly, those on board being in
continual fear lest the floating masses should crash
down upon them.</p>

<p>General Montcalm was fast losing patience. But
for Mercèdes he would have landed, and made his way
as best he could across country to Quebec; and one
day, as Mercèdes was standing behind him, he gave
expression to this wish with a certain amount of
irritability.</p>

<p>“Father,” said she unhesitatingly, “I have not come
to be a hindrance, but a help and comfort to you; if
you hold back because of me, your duty will suffer. I
am young and strong, and Marthe is well now and will
be much better off the ship than on it. Let us land
with you and make our way to Quebec.”</p>

<p>The General looked down upon the brave little
creature and smiled. “You do not know what you
are proposing, my child; it would be a difficult journey
for men, impossible for you: it is not to be thought
of.”</p>

<p>“General, do you see that canoe paddling towards
us? I have been watching it for some time; it is
bearing down upon us, and, if I mistake not, is full
of Indians,” said Chevalier Levis, and he handed the
General his long glass.</p>

<p>“You are right; they are coming straight up the
river. I wonder whether it means peace or war. If
I only knew the temper of the tribes towards us!”
said Montcalm.</p>

<p>“That remains for us to find out in the future,”
answered the Chevalier; “but they are decidedly gaining
upon us, and if I mistake not there is a white man
amongst them. Do you see that fellow standing up
with the skin round his shoulders toga fashion, and
the fur cap on his head?”</p>

<p>He had hardly finished speaking when the canoe
glided up alongside the <i>Licorne</i>, and the man they
had been observing called out in French:</p>

<p>“We are friends.”</p>

<p>“It is well,” said Montcalm, stooping over the
bulwarks; “you are welcome. Will you come on
board?”</p>

<p>“Willingly,” answered Charles Langlade, for it was
he; and easily, without the slightest apparent effort, he
swung himself up the sides of the great ship and
stood in their midst, such a noble specimen of
humanity that the General, stepping forward, held out
his hand, saying,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Who are you? and what are you doing amongst
those savages?”</p>

<p>A ringing, joyous laugh responded to this question.
“I am Charles Langlade,” he said, “descended from
the first French colonists, and now an Indian chief.
They are my people, and I belong to them,” and then
he rapidly told such portions of his story as he deemed
advisable.</p>

<p>“But if you so desired to serve France, why did
you not join the regular Canadian government and
army?” asked the Chevalier Levis.</p>

<p>“When you have been in Quebec six weeks,
and have made acquaintance with those who at
present govern Canada, you will have no need to
ask me that question,” answered Charles. “For
months I have been waiting for your coming. If
Canada is to be saved, it will be by you and not
by them. And now I am on my way to Quebec
with some six hundred men of my tribe; and when
I saw your ships coming up the St. Lawrence, I knew
that at last the old country had remembered us, and
so I put off to see if I could be of any service to you.”</p>

<p>“Indeed you can,” said Montcalm eagerly. “I am
very anxious to get to Quebec myself as quickly as
possible; but being utterly ignorant of the country
and the mode of travelling, I am at a loss how to
proceed.”</p>

<p>“If you are willing to entrust yourself to me, I think
the journey can be accomplished without great difficulty.
Alone you would find it almost impossible. It is the
season of the year when we take our furs up to
Quebec for sale: if you will accompany us, I will ensure
your reaching the city in safety, and as rapidly
as may be.”</p>

<p>“I should be very grateful,” said the General, “but
I am not alone. I cannot well leave my daughter and
her servant to land with the troops.”</p>

<p>“Your daughter!” exclaimed Charles; for wrapped
in a great cloak, with the hood drawn down over her
face to protect it from the wind, Mercèdes, standing
behind the officers, had escaped observation. Now she
stepped forward, threw back her hood, and showed a
small white face, whiter and thinner than when she
left France, and with eyes which looked preternaturally
large and brilliant.</p>

<p>“I can travel,” she said; “I am not afraid either of
the cold or of the fatigue. I am very strong.” The
pure intonation of the gentle voice, the delicate refinement
of the high-bred girl, were evident, even in these
few simple words, and came home to Charles Langlade
with peculiar force, unaccustomed as he was to civilised
life.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle wishes to travel by land to Quebec?”
he said, looking at her and instinctively baring his
head before her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered. “If my father goes I must
go too; I cannot be a hindrance to him.”</p>

<p>“It will be difficult,” he said. “The snow and ice
are only partially melted; there are still large fields
of ice. You do not know our Canada; it is a rude
country. If it were mid-winter it would be better
than now; then the rivers are frozen over and the
land is covered with snow, and with skates, sleighs,
and snowshoes we can travel easily and rapidly; but
now the thaw has set in, and the rivers are no longer
safe, the floods are rising, and the land is inundated.”</p>

<p>“You said you could take my father by land to
Quebec,” she answered, speaking imperatively; “therefore
you must do it, and I and Marthe must go likewise.
You know you can if you will to do so.”</p>

<p>He could not help smiling; she appeared such a child
to him, so utterly fearless because so utterly ignorant
of danger.</p>

<p>Take her! Of course he could take her, if, as she
said, he so willed it; and it seemed suddenly as if he
had no will but hers.</p>

<p>“It can be done, General,” he said, turning to the
Marquis. “If you will trust me, I will conduct your
party to Quebec.”</p>

<p>“Will it be safe?” said Chevalier Levis. “You do
not know this man,” he added in a low voice to the
General.</p>

<p>“If I say it is safe, who will dare gainsay me?” said
Charles Langlade haughtily.</p>

<p>“We will go, father,” said Mercèdes, laying her hand
on the General’s arm.</p>

<p>He hesitated one moment; then he looked up at
the Canadian hunter, saying, “I will trust you. Go
I must, for my duty calls me. When shall we
start?”</p>

<p>“It is too late to-day; to-morrow at dawn I will be
here to fetch you.”</p>

<p>“It is well; we will await you,” said the General.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER VIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.1em'>BY LAND</span>
</h2>


<p>The dawn had hardly broken over the land when
a low prolonged whistle intimated to General
Montcalm and his party that Charles Langlade, true
to his promise, awaited them. The cold was intense,
more especially to those born and bred in the sunny
plains of Provence, and Mercèdes and her foster-mother
Marthe, notwithstanding all their resolution,
shivered under their thick furs, as they stood on the
deck of the <i>Licorne</i> for the last time. Charles Langlade
leapt on board, saluted the General and his officers, and
then, turning to Mercèdes, said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“You are still quite decided to make the venture,
Mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” she answered in a clear, sweet voice, which
struck like the notes of a silver bell on the Canadian’s
ear.</p>

<p>“It is well,” he answered. “I think we shall be
fortunate. Snow has fallen all night; it is freezing now;
travelling will be easier than I expected.” He left her,
and helped to hand what little luggage the travellers
ventured to take with them into the canoe. No
Indians had accompanied him on the present occasion;
he had only brought his faithful John Stone, who had
rarely left him since together they had bidden adieu
to New England.</p>

<p>He was standing up in the canoe now, ready to
receive the strangers. Mercèdes was the first to be
lowered; Marthe, Estève, and the two servants followed.
The General lingered to say a few parting words to the
officers he left in command; then he, too, dropped
into the canoe, and took his place beside his daughter.
A few seconds later the canoe was paddled to the
shore.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Mademoiselle,” said Charles Langlade,
and quietly he took Mercèdes in his arms and leapt on
land with her. John Stone did as much for Marthe.
Two Indians were awaiting them; one picked up the
canoe, the other the luggage, and all disappeared
in the direction of the forest. It was the middle of
April, but the land was still snow-bound, though the
thaw which had set in had begun to loosen the ice on
the lakes and rivers: it had been an unusually severe
and prolonged winter.</p>

<p>Charles Langlade produced snowshoes for the party,
and having duly adjusted them they started.</p>

<p>“As soon as we have crossed the forest we shall gain
the open country for some miles,” Charles explained to
the General, “and sleighs will then carry us rapidly
over the ground.” But after their long confinement
on the ship, the travellers found walking for miles
over the snow-covered ground so fatiguing that, after
a couple of hours’ march, they were obliged to rest
before entering the forest. A clearance was made, a
huge fire lighted, round which they all gathered,
wrapped in skins and blankets to protect them from
the cold winds. Mercèdes was so exhausted that, after
partaking of some food, she lay with her head on her
father’s shoulder and fell asleep.</p>

<p>When she awoke she found herself being carried by
two strong arms. She was so muffled up that she could
not in the least see who her bearer was, and a sensation
of unreasoning fear crept over her. “Father,” she
called out, trying to move.</p>

<p>“Gently, Mademoiselle,” said a voice which she
recognised at once. “You have had a good rest, and
will be glad to walk now, I daresay,” and she felt herself
placed on the ground, and her wraps loosened from
around her.</p>

<p>The whole party had stopped, and, as she stood in
their midst, her father said, smiling,&#8212;</p>

<p>“You’ve had the best of it, Mercèdes; we are nearly
done up again, and you are fresh as a young colt,
or ought to be. Thank Monsieur; he has carried you
for the last two hours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how could you let him?” exclaimed Mercèdes
reproachfully.</p>

<p>“We could not leave you behind, and you were sleeping
so deeply that it would have been impossible to
rouse you sufficiently for you to walk. Monsieur is
kind enough to say that your weight is nothing compared
to that of a deer.”</p>

<p>Charles laughed. “Indeed no,” he said; “you need
not fear having wearied me, Mademoiselle. I hardly
knew I had a burden, you are so small and light. But
now we must hurry forward; we have still some distance
to go before we reach the log hut where we shall put
up for the night.”</p>

<p>“Poor Marthe! Let me help you; you can hardly
drag yourself,” said Mercèdes to her foster-mother.</p>

<p>“I’m not so bad as that, Mademoiselle,” answered the
patient peasant woman; “the man’s like the master,
he’s helped me along;” and she pointed to John Stone,
who smiled and nodded without understanding her, and,
once more taking her arm, he almost carried her over
the ground.</p>

<p>The day was drawing to a close when they reached
the log or lumber camp, and saw the smoke rising
straight in the air, giving promise at least of shelter
and of warmth.</p>

<p>These log or lumber camps were and are still all constructed
on much the same model, being composed of
pine trunks, placed lengthwise one above the other,
with a sloping roof covered over with pine boughs, and
often, as on the present occasion, with a thick layer
of snow. The fire is in the centre, and the inmates lie
on pallets made of the soft twigs of the spruce, with
their feet inwards, and well wrapped up in rugs and
blankets. None but those who have experienced it
can conceive the comfort of a log hut in the depths
of a primeval forest. When Charles Langlade and his
party arrived it was already fairly crowded: but room
was instantly made for the new-comers; they were
welcomed with true, genuine hospitality, such as is often
lacking in more civilised countries. They were offered
a share of the coarse but wholesome food&#8212;salt pork,
bread, and potatoes, washed down with a weak decoction
of a sort of herb tea. Mercèdes and Marthe, with the
wife of the lumber-man, were the only women, amidst
a score of men; but they were treated with the most
perfect respect, the warmest and most secluded corner
being assigned to them; and although every available
space was occupied, there was no impurity in the
atmosphere, as an enormous log fire was kept constantly
burning, and the apartment was thus freely
ventilated through the large smoke flue of the roof.
It would have required far greater discomfort to have
prevented any of the party from resting, so thoroughly
were they all worn out with the unaccustomed method
of travelling and the exhilarating air they had inhaled
all day. So it came to pass that, wrapped in furs and
blankets on the primitive pallets, they fell asleep, and
did not awake till with the dawn of day their companions
began to move; then they arose, and, after a
frugal meal, started off once more.</p>

<p>There had been a heavy frost that night, which
enabled them to run with ease on snowshoes, with
which they had now become familiar; therefore the
fatigue was less, and before noon they had reached the
border of the forest. Here they found the two Indians
awaiting them with sleighs, in which, after resting for
a couple of hours, they started off again. This new
way of travelling appeared to them simply delightful,
notwithstanding the cold wind which cut their faces
as they flew across the country.</p>

<p>“We must hurry on,” said Charles Langlade to the
General, who, with Mercèdes and Marthe, occupied his
sleigh; “the thaw is coming, and then the roads will
be impassable.”</p>

<p>Several times they were stopped by rivers or broad
streams, but they always found the Indians waiting
for them with the canoe or raft.</p>

<p>“How have you done it? It is wonderful, such
forethought,” said the General on one occasion to
Charles.</p>

<p>“There is nothing wonderful in it,” he said. “The
Indians know where I am bound for and my needs;
they are swift of foot, and every inch of the way is
familiar to them; it is child’s play.”</p>

<p>The last part of the journey was comparatively easy;
their road lay through many a Canadian village, where
they found ready hospitality; and when by chance the
General made himself known, the enthusiasm of the
inhabitants was unbounded. The population was
entirely French, and intensely patriotic, loving the old
France with a, so to speak, idealised affection.</p>

<p>“You may rest assured they will rise to a man when
you call upon them to do so,” said Charles Langlade;
and then he added, with something very like a sigh,
“To-morrow you will reach Quebec.”</p>

<p>“Thanks to you,” said the General. “I do not
know how to express my gratitude for your services!”</p>

<p>“By making use of me whenever you can,” said
Charles hastily. “Remember, I am always ready.
I ask for nothing better than to serve the cause of
France, to keep Canada for the old country. But the
English are strong; they are determined. Pitt is
Minister, and he is sending out troops. It will be a
hard struggle, a desperate struggle; but if you conciliate
the Indians they will side with France, and
they are a power in themselves. You do not know
me yet; but in Quebec Charles Langlade’s name is
familiar, and you will learn that I am a true man,
ready to support you, and that you may have faith
in me.”</p>

<p>“You have no need to tell me that; you have proved
it,” said the General. “You are the first friend I have
made in this country; from henceforth you will rank
first in my estimation and affection.”</p>

<p>So saying, he held out his hand, and Charles
Langlade clasped it, saying solemnly, “It is a covenant
between thee and me.”</p>

<p>“Let it be so,” answered Montcalm. “And now
we must hurry forward. I cannot express to you my
anxiety to begin operations. What I have already
seen convinces me that we must conquer in the long
run.”</p>

<p>“I trust so,” answered Charles; but, nevertheless, in
his heart there was a doubt. He knew better than the
sanguine General all the difficulties and stumbling-blocks
which awaited him&#8212;party spirit, jealousies,
corruption, treason in high places. But he restrained
himself, and would not give utterance to the warning
note. “Time enough; he will find it out for himself,”
he murmured, as he turned away to give the final
orders for their last day’s march.</p>

<p>The thaw had set in now, and a south wind was
blowing. The journey was to be finished by boat up
the St. Lawrence; there was no danger, and it was
the quickest mode of transport.</p>

<p>“I am sorry it is over,” said Mercèdes, as she stood
beside her father waiting to embark.</p>

<p>The General looked down upon her and smiled.</p>

<p>“Decidedly Canadian travelling agrees with you;
you are looking remarkably well. I think your mother
would hardly know you.”</p>

<p>And he was right. The sallow-faced, thin girl had
utterly changed: a rich softness, a glow of colour now
tinged her cheeks; her lips were red, her eyes clear
and bright like stars; the sharpness of feature had given
place to a rounded symmetry. She was not beautiful,
she could never be that; but she was pleasant to look
upon&#8212;a picture of youth, wrapped in the dark sable
cloak, the hood fastened underneath her chin framing
the young face with its dark outline. Ten days of
life and exercise in the open air had transformed
Mercèdes.</p>

<p>“She’s never looked thus, Monsieur le Marquis, since
she was a baby,” said Marthe, “and I used to carry her
out into the vineyards. I never could imagine why
from a brown rosy child she grew so pale; it’s air she
wanted.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I suppose so,” replied the Marquis carelessly,
and then they descended the bank and entered the
boats.</p>

<p>Charles Langlade sat in the stern behind Mercèdes,
but he was silent. Had it been summer-time the
scenery up the stately river would have been lovely,
but winter still rested on all things. Not a green hue
so much as tinged the black branches of the trees; only
the groves of pines, upon the summits of which the
snow still rested, gave colour to the landscape. They
shot past the snowy fall of Montmorenci, with its
perpetual leaping avalanche, along the low shores of
the beautiful Isle of Orleans, where the wild grape
festooned the primitive forest, and won from old
Cartier the name of the Isle of Bacchus. Here and
there villages clustered round slim-spired churches in
the vales, or on some gentle height; it was no longer
the wild desolation of the forest, but the gradual
growth of civilisation creeping upon them, until at last
Quebec with its “mural-crowned” and castled rock
rose before them.</p>

<p>It had been decided that they should land just
outside Quebec, rest for the night at a farmhouse
tenanted by friends of Charles Langlade, and enter the
city the following morning. It was almost dark when
they reached their destination, and as they left the
boat and walked up to the farm, Charles found himself
beside Mercèdes and Marthe.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” he said, in a low tone, his voice
trembling slightly, “I am glad of this opportunity of
wishing you adieu. I shall be far on my way to join
my tribe before the sun is risen to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Will you?” said Mercèdes. “I am so sorry; you
have been so good to me. I wish it were all to
come over again. Cannot you go with us to
Quebec?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he answered; “your words give me
great happiness. I can go no farther with you now,
but it will not be long before we meet again, I
trust.”</p>

<p>“Meet again!” answered Mercèdes; and if he could
have looked into her face he would have seen a shadow
cross it. “Who can tell? It is not very likely we shall
meet again. I am going to the Convent of St. Ursula
to be a nun.”</p>

<p>“Ah no!” he exclaimed; “you must not; you are
too brave and good to shut yourself away from the
world.”</p>

<p>“But I must,” she said; “it was decided long ago,
when I was a child.”</p>

<p>He made no answer, but set his teeth hard.</p>

<p>“Adieu, Mademoiselle,” he murmured; then caught
her hand, raised it to his lips, dropped it, and was
gone.</p>

<p>Mercèdes stood still with a pained feeling at her
heart, and a regretful longing for the world which had
suddenly become so pleasant in her eyes. She drew
a short, impatient sigh.</p>

<p>“Come, Marthe,” she said; “my father will be
wondering why we linger;” and they hurried forward.</p>

<p>“He need not have bidden me adieu to-night,” she
thought, when an hour later she stood at the window
of the room which had been allotted for her use, and
looked up at the sky, brilliant with myriads of stars.
She could not guess that he was gazing up at her from
behind the garden fence&#8212;the star of his life, although
he knew it not.</p>

</h2>


<p>“Loïs, there are five or six men on horseback just
come up through the village; they are outside the
gate, and are asking for Roger. Where’s mother?”
and Marie Langlade dashed into the kitchen, where
Loïs, her sleeves tucked up above the elbows, was busy
kneading the bread.</p>

<p>“Roger won’t be back till to-morrow; he’s gone up
country with Stark and Bradstreet after some cattle
which are missing. There was a rumour of the Indians
having been seen down the river, and he’s gone to
reconnoitre. Mother is with Mistress Cleveland; she
was ailing, and sent Charlie up to ask her to come
down. She went an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Then you must come out and speak to the
strangers,” said Marie. “They are different from the
men who usually come this way; they are neither
hunters nor merchants, and they sit so straight on
their horses and look so grand, and their speech is soft
and pleasant.”</p>

<p>“I will come,” said Loïs, smiling at the description;
and taking her hands out of the kneading-trough, she
quickly washed them, drew down her sleeves, and went
out into the porch, followed by Marie.</p>

<p>They were a great contrast, those two sisters,&#8212;Loïs
in the dawn of early womanhood, with her soft dark
hair and rich, ripe complexion, quiet and composed, as
eldest daughters, upon whom tired mothers are often
wont to shift a portion of their burdens, frequently
are; whilst Marie was not yet seventeen, and fair as
a northern maiden, with rippling golden-hued hair, a
rose-leaf complexion, forget-me-not blue eyes; not
beautiful in feature, but fresh and pure and lovable.
Very pleasant they looked as they came out together,
and at sight of them the foremost horseman sprang to
the ground, opened the garden gate, and, doffing his
military cap, came towards them.</p>

<p>“You are asking, my sister tells me, for Roger
Boscowen,” said Loïs, returning his salute. “He is
not at home; he is gone on an expedition, and will not
be back for some days perhaps; we can never tell how
long he may absent himself.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” said the stranger, in a rich, musical
voice, and with an accent which told Loïs that he was
no colonist, but an Englishman fresh from the old
country; “doubtless,” he continued, “there is some inn
where we can put up our horses and remain until his
return?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered Loïs; “but if you have come on
business to Roger, you had better wait and see Father
Nat. You look travel-stained; have you come from far?”</p>

<p>“We have come all the way from Albany,” answered
the stranger, smiling pleasantly, “and we wish to
take up our abode in your village&#8212;at least, for a
time.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Loïs, looking surprised; but too modest
to question him further, she added, “If you will go with
your men to the house yonder I will send for Father
Nat, and you can explain your business to him.”</p>

<p>“But is not this Roger Boscowen’s house?” asked
the traveller.</p>

<p>“No,” said Loïs; “this is Alpha Marsh, the Langlades’
homestead; the Boscowens live next door at
Omega Marsh. But indeed it is much the same, only
as you ask for Roger you had better go to his own
place. I will send men to take your horses, and
Nokomis will provide refreshments for your men.”
She bent her head with a certain stately grace, and
re-entered the house.</p>

<p>“Quick, Marie,” she said; “find Jim and tell him to
go in search of Father Nat, and let him know of the
arrival of the new-comers. I will go round to Nokomis
and see that she deals out proper hospitality; she is
not over given to generosity.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later the strangers were seated in
Omega Marsh kitchen, partaking of a plentiful meal,
which was rendered still more palatable served as it
was by two such handmaids as Loïs and Marie. Father
Nat had returned in haste when he heard of the
arrival of the strangers, but he would not allow their
chief to enter into any explanations until he had
refreshed himself.</p>

<p>They were five in number: four men in the prime
of life, and one lad of seventeen, whom Nathaniel
recognised immediately as the son of an old acquaintance,
William Parkmann, of Massachusetts. He was
a mere boy in appearance, unusually tall and lanky,
overgrown one might say, with an almost girl’s face&#8212;he
looked so very young: yet there was no lack of
character in it; the mouth and chin were firm, and the
hazel eyes intelligent and even searching.</p>

<p>When the supper was cleared away, and the jar of
tobacco and long clay pipes had been placed upon
the table, the evident leader of the party turned to
Nathaniel, and said with infinite courtesy,&#8212;</p>

<p>“After having partaken of your generous hospitality,
it is time we introduced ourselves to you, my
host; especially as it is our intention to remain some
time in the settlement, if you will suffer us to do
so.”</p>

<p>“Why should I hinder you? If I mistake not,
you are officers in his Gracious Majesty’s army,” said
Nathaniel.</p>

<p>“You have guessed rightly,” answered the same
speaker. “I am Brigadier Howe, and my companions
are Lieutenants Pringle, Philips, and Roche. I need
scarcely tell you the importance of the struggle going
on between France and England; it has not yet reached
its height, but it will ere long, and it behoves us all
to be prepared to fight to the best of our abilities for
our country and her honour. I am of opinion that
the ordinary system of European warfare will prove a
failure when pitted against Indian and Canadian
fighting; and unless we can acquire some practical
knowledge of their tactics, we run a very great chance
of being worsted. For the last three years you have
suffered frightful aggressions along the borderland
from the Indians and French, and have only been
protected by the courage and abilities of your volunteer
men, your Rangers, as they are called, whose captain,
Roger the Ranger, is, I believe, your son. His name is
in everybody’s mouth as the man of all others the most
capable of rendering assistance to the colony in its
present straits. Thirley, the Governor of Massachusetts,
and William Johnson, of New York, Commander of the
Massachusetts Volunteers, cannot say too much in his
favour; and therefore we four officers of his Majesty’s
army have come to him with a request that, during
the present winter, he will enroll us as members of
his corps of Rangers, subject us to their training, and
allow us to accompany him on all his expeditions;
thus we shall learn forest warfare and the ways of the
enemy, and know how to deal with them. Your son
will be doing inestimable service to the regular army
by thus initiating us. Do you think he will consent
to do this?”</p>

<p>“I cannot say,” answered Nathaniel. “My son has
thrown himself heart and soul into the defence of the
colony. But for his fame I scarcely think our settlement
would have remained so long unmolested. You
are acquainted with the frightful rapine and murder
which the red warriors have committed in the border
settlements of Virginia and Pennsylvania. The Quakers
even, much against their will, have been driven into
passing a militia law, by the sight of the bodies of the
massacred men paraded about the streets of Philadelphia.
Massachusetts has been foremost in resisting French
and Indian aggression, and has taken the lead in the
preparation for war. I have heard Roger say that the
British army, disciplined as it is, and with officers of
unrivalled bravery, will, from their ignorance of the
country and of the style of warfare, be subject to many
reverses. I think he would approve of your plan,
but you must await his return; he will answer you
himself.”</p>

<p>“We are quite willing to remain here,” answered
Brigadier Howe, “if you will tell us where we can
put up.”</p>

<p>Nathaniel smiled. “You are unacquainted with
our New England hospitality,” he said. “We never
turn a stranger from our door; we deem it would bring
us ill-fortune. The Lord has sent you hither, and
until your business with Roger be settled, your place
is laid for you at my table and the guest-chamber is
at your service.”</p>

<p>“But we are so numerous, and our horses will
encumber your stables,” said the Brigadier.</p>

<p>“What Omega cannot accomplish Alpha will,” he
answered quietly. “The Boscowens and Langlades,
though they live each under different roofs, form but
one household: it has been so for over four generations.”</p>

<p>“If such hospitality be amongst your traditions,
far be it from me to gainsay you,” said the Brigadier.
“But that name of Langlade struck me just now. I
heard it lately at Albany; there was much talk of
a Charles Langlade and a certain La Corne, both of
them French Canadians, who had joined the Indians,
taken squaw wives, and become of great importance
in the tribes. Surely that Langlade has no connection
with this family?”</p>

<p>Nathaniel’s brow darkened.</p>

<p>“Speak not of it,” he said sternly. “He is our
eldest son. Above all things do not utter his name
before Roger; they were as brothers, and he has become
a thorn in his flesh.”</p>

<p>He had hardly finished speaking when the door
opened, and Martha, accompanied by the minister and
his wife, entered. Mistress Cleveland’s ailments were
frequent, but never of a very serious nature&#8212;often little
more than an excuse for sending to Alpha Marsh and
getting Martha Langlade down for a good day’s gossip.
When, therefore, the news came that strangers had
arrived, she declared herself quite equal to the exertion
of accompanying her husband and Martha&#8212;indeed, the
walk she felt sure would be beneficial to her; and so
they set forth together, curious to know who the
newcomers might be. Marcus and the younger members
of the family soon followed, so that the kitchen was
full; and the murmur of many voices and occasional
laughter struck pleasantly on the ear.</p>

<p>Marcus, though some years older, promptly made
friends with William Parkmann, and heard with interest
all that was going on in the States.</p>

<p>The young man spoke with enthusiastic affection
of Brigadier Howe; to his young imagination he was
evidently a hero.</p>

<p>“He will save the colonies,” he affirmed, “because
he’s young and goes to work in the right way. He
is not likely to fall into an ambuscade, as General
Braddock did.”</p>

<p>“We will hope not,” said Marcus; “one such experience
is sufficient.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would talk of something besides fighting
and Indians,” said Marie, leaning her elbows on the
table. “It is the same thing every day. I am so
tired of it.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will be much more tired before
it is over, Marie,” said her brother; “the great struggle
has yet to come. One thing is certain, French and
English cannot live together as neighbours unless the
former will take the oath of allegiance, and that their
priests will never allow them to do.”</p>

<p>“I hope we shall never hear again of anything so
dreadful as the expulsion from Grandpré two years ago,”
said Loïs. “Fancy husbands and wives, parents and
children, torn away from each other, sent hundreds of
miles apart, never to meet again! That seems to me
worse than death; the yearning and the longing, the
never-ceasing anxiety, must be so very terrible!”
and tears filled her eyes, whilst her voice trembled
with emotion.</p>

<p>“Yes, worse than death,” said a low, deep voice
behind her. “Death means peace, reunion, love. Why
should we fear it, if we but remember His promise,
‘<i>Fear not</i>, I am with thee’?” Loïs turned round,
and met the kindly eyes of Brigadier Howe bent on
her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, “there are many worse things
than death&#8212;this continuous warfare, the horrors of
the savages, brother warring against brother. Oh!
when will it end? when shall we have peace?” and
the tears which she had striven to restrain rolled down
her face.</p>

<p>“There, there, Loïs,” said Marcus soothingly. “It
will come in due time; we are all striving after it.”</p>

<p>“The war is drawing to a close,” said Brigadier
Howe. “England has taken up the gauntlet in good
earnest at last; William Pitt is at the helm, and he
will not rest until Canada is a settled English
Protestant colony.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” said Minister Cleveland; “and now, mistress,
it’s time we went home; it is getting late, and
the travellers will be glad to go to rest. Good-night
to you all,” and there was a great hand-shaking. Loïs
helped Mistress Cleveland on with her cloak and hood,
commending her to be careful not to take a chill; then
the lantern was lit, and the young people trooped down
to the gate to start them on their way home. Martha
took this opportunity of speaking to Father Nat.</p>

<p>“You must not take all the five guests, father,” she
said; “have you forgotten that we also have our
guest-chamber?” and she drew herself up with
dignity.</p>

<p>“Not likely I should forget,” he answered; “choose
which of them you will have, Martha, or shall they
cast lots? Women rule the roost here, sir, as they
do elsewhere,” he said, turning to Howe. “Mistress
Martha will have it she has a right to the honour
of entertaining some of your party; you went to her
gate first, it seems.”</p>

<p>“True,” said Howe, smiling. “We are flattered by
your desire, madam. We think there is one amongst
us who has already found a flame, and is trying to
singe his wings; if she lead the way, he will not
refuse to follow,” and as he spoke he looked towards
where Marie and William Parkmann were talking to
each other.</p>

<p>“Tut!” said Martha. “Marie’s only a child.”</p>

<p>“To our mothers we are always children,” said
Howe sweetly.</p>

<p>“He’s a nice lad,” said Martha kindly; “let him
come, and one other.”</p>

<p>“The young with the young,” said Howe, smiling.
“What do you say to Roche?”</p>

<p>“He is welcome,” said Martha, smiling.</p>

<p>“Roche and Parkmann,” said Howe, speaking with
a tone of military command, “you are billeted on
Dame Martha Langlade.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” answered the two young men gladly.</p>

<p>A general move followed, good-nights were exchanged,
Marcus helped Father Nat show his guests
to their rooms, and then they all separated; only
Father Nat and Brigadier Howe remained in the
chimney corner.</p>

<p>“If you’ve no objection, we’ll smoke one pipe together
before we part company, Father Nat. I am anxious
to ask you a few questions,” said Howe.</p>

<p>“You can ask,” answered the father; “maybe I’ll
answer you, maybe I won’t.”</p>

<p>“I think you will answer me,” said Howe gently, as
he filled his pipe from the jar of tobacco Father Nat
pushed towards him. Stooping, he picked an ember
out of the hearth and lit it, and then he leant back
thoughtfully in the old armchair as the white smoke
slowly curled up the wide open chimney.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER X</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.1em'>A NEW FRIENDSHIP</span>
</h2>


<p>“What I am about to ask you is from no idle
curiosity, but because my interest has been
aroused for some time past by all I have heard of your
son and his exploits. He is spoken of as a hard man, a
splendid disciplinarian, reckless of his own life, fearing
neither God nor man, with but one object in life&#8212;the
driving of the Indian and the French out of the country.
Is this so?”</p>

<p>A moment’s hesitation, then Father Nat answered:
“It is true. Until three years ago there was not a
more God-fearing, braver, brighter lad along the length
and breadth of the New England border than Roger
Boscowen. He and Charles Langlade were cited as model
young men; there were no better farmers, no better
hunters than they, and their conduct was irreproachable.
I seem to hear them still whistling as they went and
came about the place. Roger is my only child, and
somehow it grew to be a sort of accepted thing that in
due time he should marry Loïs. You saw her to-day,
the eldest Langlade girl; a sweeter woman it would
be impossible to find on the face of the earth. They
were very fond of each other: when the young men were
at home the three were always together. Ah! those
were happy days; but from the hour Charles Langlade
left his home the change began. Roger struggled
against it at first; but after the affair at Miamis, in
which Old Britain was killed and Roger nearly met
his death by the hand of Charles himself, he has been
a changed man, sombre and stern. He told Loïs in
a few words that all was over between them. What
actually passed no one knows, but since that day,
beyond a simple ‘good day’ or ‘good evening,’ they
have never been seen to speak together. He has
never recrossed the threshold of Alpha Marsh, and
when he is at Omega Marsh, neither her mother
nor Loïs comes here. He endures the younger ones,
but he seldom looks at or speaks with them. He
is rarely at home, and has not been to chapel for
more than three years. When the minister would
have exhorted him, he turned away with a bitter
laugh. His heart is hardened, his whole nature is
changed!”</p>

<p>And Nat shook the ashes out of his pipe and relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>“It is a sad story; something I had heard of it
before coming here,” said Howe. “But cheer up,
father. God’s ways are not man’s ways: it is hard
for us to understand His dealings with us,&#8212;better
not try; better in simple faith believe that what ‘He
doeth is well done.’ I have heard Roger’s exploits
spoken of as something marvellous. His knowledge
of Indian warfare is so perfect that it is almost impossible
for them to waylay him. It is averred that
he could conduct an army through the forest on
the darkest night. Probably had he continued to
lead the life of an ordinary hunter he would never
have attained this degree of perfection; and we need
such a man now. Surely God has raised him up for
our deliverance.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, maybe,” answered Father Nat; “Loïs has
said as much, and she is far-sighted.”</p>

<p>“She seems a right noble woman,” said Howe. “Has
she taken Roger’s desertion much to heart?”</p>

<p>“You have seen her; does she look like a love-sick
girl?” said Father Nat, almost indignantly.
“Nay, nay; our Loïs is a brave, God-fearing maiden.
She never even winced at the pain he gave her, but
went about her work as if naught had happened.
And she has never changed; she keeps my house
in order, and is her mother’s right hand. No one
ever touches Roger’s things but herself; she comes
and goes from early morning till late at night, and
there is no shadow on her brow. Ah, she’s a bonnie
woman, God bless her!” and Father Nat’s voice was
husky.</p>

<p>“Truly she must be,” answered Howe; and, remembering
the words she had spoken, “There are
many things worse than death,” he recognised that
here, at least, was one who had early learnt the lesson
“to suffer and be strong.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the silence was broken by the loud barking
of dogs, and men’s steps were heard coming across the
courtyard, followed by a shrill whistle.</p>

<p>“It’s Roger!” said Nathaniel, rising. “I never
thought he’d be back so soon; either he has found
the rumours false or he wants more men.”</p>

<p>He left the kitchen, and Howe heard the back door
unbarred, and by the sounds he could guess that three
or four men had entered the house. They conversed
for some time in low voices; then there was a clatter
of knives and forks. The officer felt his presence
was causing inconvenience; yet he sat on, so intense
was his desire to see this man of whom he had heard
so much.</p>

<p>His patience was rewarded after a time; he heard
leave-taking, and the outer door open and shut. A few
minutes after Father Nat reappeared, and behind him
towered a man of unusual height, broad-shouldered,
large-limbed, dressed in a plain grey hunting suit with
tan-leather leggings. His face was rough-hewn, cut
in a large mould; hair and beard, both of a reddish
hue, were cropped close; his eyes were of that peculiarly
dark grey showing blue in some lights, and black
when the feelings were wrought to an unusual pitch.
In childhood and youth they had been remarkable
for their brightness, now at most times they were
sombre with a lurid light. Taken as a whole, it
was a passionate face, as of a man at war with himself
and with the world. His brow was broad and
massive; there was intellect and strength in every
line; but the predominant expression was one of
pain, of suffering, of revolt, indicated more especially
by the two deep lines between his eyebrows.
He went straight across the room and held out his
hand to Howe, who rose and came forward to meet
him.</p>

<p>“My father has told me your purpose,” he said,
“and I know who you are. I will not insult you
by asking you if you really mean to subject yourself
to such training; you have said it, that is
enough. If, when you have tried it for one month,
you or your companions find yourselves physically
unequal to withstand the hardships of such a life,
you can stop; you will at all events have learnt
enough to help you to avoid the mistakes which
have already been made, and which have proved so
disastrous.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I desire,” answered Howe;
“and I need say no more, for I see you recognise
how important it is that we British officers should
have the knowledge necessary to enable us to
discipline and command our men in this new warfare.”</p>

<p>“I do fully; I have thought so for a long time.
I have often wondered why you failed to take steps to
acquire that knowledge,” answered Roger.</p>

<p>“Because officers are scarce,” said Howe. “I have
at last, with difficulty, obtained the leave necessary to
permit me to join your scouting parties this winter.
In the spring, of course, we shall have active engagements, and, I hope, soon make an end of the war.
Pitt is determined to carry things with a high hand,
and is sending out reinforcements, whereas France is
satisfied to leave everything to her general; and though
Montcalm is a splendid officer, and the Canadians
and Indians are devoted to him, he must in the
long run give in, unless he receives fresh troops from
home.”</p>

<p>“Which is not likely,” answered Roger, seating
himself, and throwing a fresh log of wood on the dying
embers.</p>

<p>Brigadier Howe was at this time three-and-thirty
years of age&#8212;nearly six years Roger’s senior, but he
looked much younger. They represented two distinct
types: the delicately nurtured, high-bred Englishman,
with less actual physical strength than his
New England brother, but possessed of an equal
power of endurance, because of the stronger moral
principle, the higher spiritual and mental perfection
to which he had attained, bringing the body into
subjection.</p>

<p>That night those two sat long over the fire. Father
Nat wisely left them together; and when they parted
both recognised in the other a kindred soul. Their
interests were in common, their object the same:
the conquest of Canada, the driving out of an alien
power; only the incentives differed. Brigadier Howe
fought for England and for the Protestant faith,
Roger because he hated the Indian and the Canadian.
No personal feelings animated Howe; with Roger they
were entirely personal&#8212;vengeance for the loss of
his friend, and hatred because of the pain that loss
inflicted on him. Neither of them recognised these
shades of difference; their aim, and the end they had
in view, united them, and they were both satisfied
with each other.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.1em'>DIPLOMACY</span>
</h2>


<p>“Monsieur, it is quite impossible for us to allow
you to carry such a plan into execution. If
you are barbarous enough to even dream of shutting
this poor child up in a convent, give her time at least
first to live and to enjoy her youth. New France is not
like old France: we are not over-burdened with young
maidens here; indeed, they are greatly in request!”</p>

<p>The speaker, Madame Péan, was a very beautiful
woman, a Canadian by birth, who had married a
French officer, Major Péan, and because of her beauty
was the acknowledged leader of fashion in Quebec.
All the world bowed down before her, from the Governor,
the Marquis de Vaudreuil, to the ugly hunchback
Maurier, the ally of the two men, Bigot and Varin,
who for some time past had been growing rich on the
misery of Canada.</p>

<p>Immediately upon his arrival at Quebec Montcalm
had been introduced to Madame Péan, and was
astonished to find there a <i>salon</i> which might have
rivalled any at Versailles. “The ladies are graceful
and elegant,” he wrote to his wife, “and by no means
behind the fashion.” Having heard that Mercèdes had
accompanied her father, Madame Péan took the first
opportunity which offered to ask the General if he
would bring his daughter to one of her receptions,
to which request he replied by saying that Mercèdes
would not go into society, that when he left Quebec
for his first campaign, which would be in the course
of the next fortnight, she would enter the Convent of
the Ursulines.</p>

<p>“She came over with me,” he said, “that I might
have the consolation of seeing her from time to time
during my exile, and as her vocation was a religious
life it mattered little whether she followed it in the
new or the old country.”</p>

<p>It was this speech which had called forth Madame
Péan’s somewhat indignant protest.</p>

<p>“But, Madame,” answered the General, “my
daughter is very young, and is only accompanied by
her nurse. I cannot look after her. I shall not even
have an establishment in Quebec; my duties will call
me here, there, and everywhere. I shall live with my
soldiers. What would you have me do with a young
girl under such circumstances?”</p>

<p>Madame Péan laughed, such a pleasant, easy laugh,
and, seating herself, signed the General to take a place
on the sofa beside her.</p>

<p>“Certainly those are difficulties,” she said, “but
by no means insurmountable. Tell me honestly,
General, would you have any objection to a rich
husband for your daughter, if one could be found?”</p>

<p>“I have never thought of such a thing. Mercèdes
has always been our little nun,” he answered.</p>

<p>“But would you object?” she persisted.</p>

<p>“Not if the child wished it, and if, besides being
rich, the man were honourable and of good family,”
said the General.</p>

<p>“Leave that to me,” answered the lady. “You
must let your ‘little nun,’ as you call her, take up her
abode under my roof during your absence, General.
It will be quite the right thing. This is a great barrack
of a place, and there are three empty rooms just above
my own apartments; now I think of it, they overlook
the gardens of the Ursulines. She can contemplate at
her leisure her future abode, in case my matrimonial
scheme should fail, which I do not think probable; I
am proverbially fortunate,” and she tossed her fair head
and smiled with conscious power.</p>

<p>“I cannot sufficiently thank you for the interest you
take in my daughter,” answered Montcalm. “I will
consider the matter, and, if you will allow me, will
bring you my answer to-morrow at this same hour; in
any case, my daughter shall tender you her thanks in
person.” He rose, and bowed low before the reigning
beauty; she smiled graciously, and extended her hand,
which, according to the custom of those days, he raised
to his lips; then once more bowing, he withdrew to
make room for others who were waiting to pay their
homage, for Madame Péan held a mimic court, and it
was rumoured, indeed, that with many in high places
her word was law.</p>

<p>The General did not remain long in the <i>salons</i>, and
as soon as he had disappeared there arose an excited
murmur in the group surrounding Madame Péan. She
rose. “You will never tell me again I am no diplomate,
Monsieur,” she said, turning to the Marquis de
Vaudreuil.</p>

<p>The Governor smiled. “Who is your last conquest,
Madame?” he said. “Not Montcalm? He is as impregnable
as Quebec itself!”</p>

<p>“We shall see,” said the lady. “There is a weak
point in every fortress. Have you heard that he has
been mad enough to bring a daughter out here, to
make her a nun at the Ursulines opposite?”</p>

<p>“And you are bent upon frustrating such pious
designs?” said the Intendant Bigot, who, notwithstanding
his unprepossessing appearance, managed to
ingratiate himself with all sorts and conditions of men;
and by his lavish hospitality and readiness to oblige
was able with impunity to plunder the populace and
secure for himself and his friends immense fortunes.
It is affirmed that one company, with which Major Péan,
the husband of the fair lady we have just introduced
to our readers, was associated, made in the course of one
year a net profit of twelve millions. This was done, to
a great extent, by monopolies. Bigot, himself a native
of Bordeaux, traded under the name of Clavarie with
the firm of Gradis &amp; Son of that city. He was known
to have made a colossal fortune, and lived with royal
splendour, dispensing lavish hospitality at the king’s
expense.</p>

<p>General Montcalm was too new a comer, and himself
of a too spotless integrity, to even suspect such
dealings; he had already been made aware that the
Governor and native authorities of Canada viewed him
with jealous suspicion, as a stranger and an intruder.
They did not recognise the necessity of his presence
amongst them. The Governor was especially irate at
having to yield precedence to him in military matters;
but the General was determined to do his utmost to
conciliate all parties, and he was ably seconded by his
first and second officers, the Chevaliers Levis and
Bougainville.</p>

<p>In answer to Bigot’s half-mocking query, Madame
Péan nodded her head, and the sparkling face laughed
acquiescence.</p>

<p>“I should rather think so,” she said. “I mean to
have and to hold her as a fair hostage. When the war
is over, and the Marquis sails from our coast, we will
let her go home, or to the convent, unless she become
one of ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea,” said her husband, curling his
moustache, “and you are quite capable of carrying it
into effect.”</p>

<p>“What Madame wills the gods prosper,” said
Bigot gallantly. “Has any one seen the new importation?”</p>

<p>“I caught sight of a little sallow-faced girl, with big
black eyes, walking with the General and Charles
Langlade in the lower town yesterday,” said a young
officer.</p>

<p>“Did not Charles Langlade bring the whole party
across country to Quebec?” asked Bigot.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Governor; “Montcalm would
not wait till the ships could get up the St. Lawrence,
so he hurried on in front. He’s in a perfect fever to
begin operations.”</p>

<p>“He will learn to take things more quietly presently,”
said Bigot. “In the meantime, let Madame
take the little girl in hand. According to the natural
course of events, she and Charles Langlade ought to
have managed to fall in love with each other during
their somewhat rough excursion across country. If they
have, that will be another string to our bow; if they
have not&#8212;well, dear Madame, you must manage that
they should.”</p>

<p>“And Charles Langlade’s squaw?” said Madame.</p>

<p>“Oh, she would be easily disposed of,” said Bigot
carelessly.</p>

<p>And then, as if the subject had grown unpleasant to
him, he changed the conversation.</p>

<p>In the meantime the General went slowly and
thoughtfully through the narrow, tortuous streets, past
the magnificent Jesuit College on one side and the
Ursuline Convent on the other. He was feeling depressed;
his reception by the authorities had by no
means been as hearty as he had been led to expect,
and this new proposition concerning Mercèdes also
worried him.</p>

<p>“I should have done better to leave the child at
home,” he thought.</p>

<p>At that moment he was met by Chevalier Levis,
who had arrived with the troops, and was camped
outside the town in the plain of Montmorenci.</p>

<p>“Well, General,” he said gaily, “are things going
pretty smoothly?”</p>

<p>“By no means,” answered Montcalm; “at every
step I find impediments in my way. These Canadians
take life easily; while the Indians and the English
are fighting for dominion, they seem to think nothing
of so great importance as balls and picnics.”</p>

<p>“All that will change before long,” said the
Chevalier cheerfully. “You cannot expect everybody
to view events as seriously as you do, General. I
certainly am agreeably surprised. I did not expect
to find such pleasant society and such pretty women
in Quebec; but you are above such trifles! Still, if
you will allow me to say it, do you not think it would
be wise to conciliate the powers that be?”</p>

<p>“As far as possible I most certainly do,” answered
Montcalm. “A proposition has just been made me
which puts me in an awkward position. If I refuse
I am afraid I shall give great offence, and yet I am
unwilling to agree to it.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the Chevalier.</p>

<p>They were entering the Rue St. Louis, in which
street the General had taken a small, one-storied house;
here he had settled Mercèdes and her nurse for the
time being at least.</p>

<p>“If you will come in I will tell you; your opinion
may help me to decide,” he said.</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were seated in a plainly
furnished room, the principal ornament of which was
the large white porcelain stove used to warm the
apartment during the severe Canadian winters.</p>

<p>In a few words the General told Levis his conversation
with Madame Péan. “Do you think it possible
for me to leave Mercèdes in her charge? You must
remember the child is utterly ignorant of the world,
and it seems to me it is a very gay world here in
Quebec, notwithstanding the war.”</p>

<p>“You cannot afford to offend Madame Péan”
answered Levis; “she is a power in herself, like others
at Versailles. Her <i>salon</i> is the centre of every intrigue;
her will is law. It will not harm Mademoiselle
Mercèdes to spend the next few months under the same
roof as Madame Péan, and to take her share in the
gaieties. It will be time enough when you return in
September for her to take up her abode at the Ursulines,
if she be still so minded. At least, you might explain
the position to her, and let her decide for herself.”</p>

<p>“And if Mercèdes refuses the invitation, how shall
I explain the fact satisfactorily to Madame without
incurring her anger?” asked Montcalm.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle is to call on Madame herself to-morrow,
I believe; let her explain,” said Levis. “But
I am very much mistaken if she refuse to accept the
offer.”</p>

<p>“I will call her,” said Montcalm.</p>

<p>He did so, and at the sound of his voice Mercèdes
came running into the room.</p>

<p>“Have you been in long, father?” she asked, as he
kissed her brow.</p>

<p>“No, my child,” he said. “But I have something
of importance to say to you, Mercèdes; and, remember,
before you decide one way or the other you must
reflect seriously.”</p>

<p>He had reseated himself, and, putting his arm round
her, drew her towards him.</p>

<p>“It was settled that before I left Quebec you
should go to the Ursulines. Supposing I thought it
better to delay your entering the convent, would it
grieve you very much, my daughter?”</p>

<p>Mercèdes looked at him with surprise. “Where
else should I go, my father? I could not remain here
alone,” she said.</p>

<p>“I do not suppose you could,” he answered. “This
is what has happened,” and he explained to her his
interview with Madame Péan. “She is a very great
lady, and much considered here in Quebec,” he said.
“I do not wish to offend her, and yet I honestly tell
you, Mercèdes, you will have to be very circumspect
in your conduct. You will be like a lamb in the
midst of wolves, I am afraid.”</p>

<p>“You need not be afraid for me,” said Mercèdes.
“If it be useful to you that I should go to this lady,
I am quite willing; Marthe will, of course, be with me,
and I shall only await your return.”</p>

<p>A sense of relief came over the General. He had so
much to combat with the men, that he had felt very
loth to incur female wrath.</p>

<p>“Then it is settled,” he said, “and I am very glad;
to-morrow I will introduce you. I am afraid, however,
you are badly off for fine clothes, my little nun: it
would be well for you to sally forth with Marthe and
purchase what is needful; it will not do for you to
appear in beggarly fashion before all these fine ladies.
Are you not of my opinion, Chevalier?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly. Mademoiselle Mercèdes represents
Versailles here at Quebec,” he answered, smiling.</p>

<p>“I never was at Versailles, and never expect to go
there,” said the young girl, laughing. “I should be
terrified. But here there is neither king nor queen.
These people are not even noble,” she said, with a touch
of old aristocratic pride.</p>

<p>“True, my Mercèdes,” answered her father, smiling;
“but you must not tell them so.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” she answered; “and now, if you will
give me a few louis, I will buy what is necessary for me
to have, so that I may do you credit. I only wish I
were beautiful, like my sisters.”</p>

<p>“It is as well, perhaps, that you are not,” thought
her father, giving her the gold she asked for; then she
embraced him, bowed to the Chevalier Levis, and left
the room.</p>

<p>It was with a certain degree of excitement that
Mercèdes started on her expedition. As far as she was
concerned, dress had always been a very minor consideration.
She did not belong to the world, and therefore
anything was good enough for her&#8212;mostly her mother’s
or sisters’ left-off clothing; but she had a French-woman’s
natural knack for arranging them, and so not
unfrequently her sisters observed that Mercèdes looked
better in old clothes than they did in new ones. She
felt half guilty also at the fact that she was not more
sorry at the delay occasioned by these new plans to her
entering the convent; but she satisfied her conscience
by the fact that it was her father’s will. As she and
Marthe went quickly towards the upper town, where
she believed the best stores were to be found, she was
suddenly aware of a tall figure coming towards her,
stopping in front of them, and saying, “Mademoiselle,
where are you thus hurrying?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Langlade,” she answered, holding out
her hand, “we have met just in time for you to tell
me the best stores for stuffs; we are at a loss.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mademoiselle, are you going to the ball at
the Intendance? I thought you were to retire to the
Ursulines as soon as the General left Quebec.”</p>

<p>“My father has decided otherwise,” answered Mercèdes.
“I am going to be the guest of Madame Péan
during his absence.”</p>

<p>Charles Langlade started, hesitated for a moment,
then he asked,&#8212;</p>

<p>“What is the reason of this sudden change?”</p>

<p>“That I cannot tell you,” answered Mercèdes. “My
father does not, apparently, wish to give offence,
which, if he refuse to allow me to accept Madame
Péan’s invitation, he most certainly will. After all, it
will not make much difference; it is the case of a few
months only. But I have to buy clothes and make
myself generally fitted to properly represent the
family&#8212;a difficult and unexpected task.”</p>

<p>“Which you will surely accomplish creditably,”
answered Charles, “as you will anything you set your
heart on doing.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you have such a good opinion of me,”
answered Mercèdes. “I shall certainly try, for my
dear father’s sake. And now, where can I go to make
my purchases?”</p>

<p>“Having no womankind of my own to clothe in
fashionable attire, I am somewhat at a loss,” said
Charles. “But if you will follow me I think I know a
good draper who will sell you stuffs, and may perhaps be
able to direct you where to go for your other purchases.”</p>

<p>So saying, he preceded them through the tortuous
thoroughfares of the lower town, and in a side street
came to a quaint old wooden house, the upper story
projecting over the basement, throwing a deep shadow
over the interior of what proved to be the storehouse.</p>

<p>Charles Langlade spoke a few words in a low voice
to the master, who came forward, the result of which
was that he bowed low before Mercèdes, assuring her
that his poor store was highly honoured by her patronage,
which, being unaccustomed to such homage, disconcerted
her not a little. Charles Langlade, feeling
his presence was no longer needed, took his leave, if
truth be told, with a strangely lightened heart at the
thought that Mercèdes was not so soon to disappear
behind the Convent walls.</p>

<p>Not till the store man asked Mercèdes what she
desired, did she at all realise the difficulties which
lay before her. She looked helplessly at the rich
stuffs he spread out on the counter, seeing which he
smiled. “Mademoiselle is not accustomed to make
purchases for herself,” he said. “Shall I fetch my
wife or daughter? They are in the habit of dressing
the great ladies of Quebec, and will know exactly
what it is desirable for the daughter of our General to
wear.”</p>

<p>“Do, I pray you,” said Mercèdes; and a few minutes
later Madame Thomas appeared with a young girl, two
or three years older than Mercèdes, both of them
excited and delighted at the sight of the General’s
daughter. Madame was perfectly at home in her
business, and, besides, she was motherly, with such
pleasant, homely ways that Mercèdes exclaimed at
last,&#8212;</p>

<p>“You had better send me just what you think right
and proper. I must spend as little as possible, for my
father is not rich, and has many expenses; you will
please to bear that in mind. If you could let me have
a visiting costume to-morrow, I should be glad. I am
to pay my first visit to the Intendance.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, if we sit up all night, you shall
have everything you require. Are you not our
General’s daughter, whom it is our duty as well as
our pleasure to serve?” answered Madame Thomas.
“Annette shall herself bring you your costume, and
if you will allow her she will wait and dress you.”</p>

<p>“A thousand thanks,” said Mercèdes, with her bright,
winning smile. “Now I am quite at rest. Remember,
everything is to be plain, very plain. I have come
to Canada to be a nun at the Convent of the Ursulines;
it is only for a little while I am going into the
world.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Mademoiselle, I shall be much surprised if
some gallant gentleman does not succeed in making
you change your mind,” said Madame Thomas.</p>

<p>“Oh no, indeed,” answered Mercèdes, blushing; and
with a pleasant adieu she left the stores and went
home to the little house in St. Louis Street, feeling
as if a strange new life were opening out before
her.</p>

</h2>


<p>It did not take the English officers and William
Parkmann long to settle down in their new home;
the life was so free and easy. Before they had been
a week at Marshwood they knew and were known of
the whole colony, and were immense favourites. The
dangers which surrounded the colonists were becoming
daily more and more evident. Scarcely a week passed
but what news came of villages burnt and sacked, and
of the atrocious cruelties perpetrated by the Indians.
So far Marshwood had been unmolested, owing, it was
generally supposed, to Roger’s renown and the number
of scouts or Rangers always about. Roger began at
once to put the new recruits into training, taking them
out into the forests, and organising mimic fights.
Brigadier Howe, as he chose to be called, though Roger
knew full well that his real title and rank were
Brigadier-General Lord Howe, was in right good earnest,
and applied himself thoroughly to the study of forest
warfare. His companions followed his example; they
had their hair cut close like the Rangers, dressed themselves
after the same fashion, wearing leggings to
protect them from the briers. As soon as Roger considered them sufficiently trained, they accompanied him
on expeditions to the frontier; upon which occasions
each man had to carry in his knapsack thirty pounds
of meat,&#8212;this being the only food they had to depend
upon, and which they cooked themselves,&#8212;one blanket,
and a bearskin.</p>

<p>Before the middle of November the snow lay
thick upon the ground, and the rivers were icebound.
A great stillness seemed to descend upon
the land, and the Rangers dispersed to their homes,
with the exception of a certain number of scouts, who
remained on guard. Roger was mostly with them, and
Brigadier Howe was always in his company. A great
feeling of sympathy grew up between the two men.
Different as their characters were, yet they understood
each other, Howe’s gentle, energetic nature tending
to soften and hold in check the violence and strong-headedness
of his companion. Roger learned to admire
the indomitable will which enabled this delicate nobleman,
accustomed to all the luxury and refinement of
civilised life, to face the greatest hardships willingly,
and without a murmur. Nothing held him back;
where Roger went he went, always bright and cheery,
seeming to have no thought of self. There was an
undercurrent running through his life which Roger
was slow to recognise, because he was unwilling to
do so&#8212;namely, an unobtrusive piety.</p>

<p>He made no religious boast, he was seldom heard to
speak of those things which were in very truth nearest
his heart, but his daily life bore testimony to his faith.
A small pocket Bible was his never-failing companion,
and often by the camp fire, when his comrades lay
sleeping, wrapped in their blankets and bearskins,
Roger watched him draw it forth, and by the flickering
flame peruse the sacred volume.</p>

<p>Whenever it was possible, he coaxed Roger to cease
warfare on the Sabbath Day, and to return to Marshwood,
often accomplishing the homeward journey under
very adverse circumstances and with great fatigue; but
nevertheless he was sure to be in his place in chapel,
an attentive listener to John Cleveland’s exhortations.
The minister was his most devoted admirer, and
declared to Nathaniel that the Englishman’s example
had worked a wonderful change on the young men
in the colony. Only Roger held aloof in sombre
pride. Yet, notwithstanding the coming danger which
threatened them all, and which at any moment might
overtake them, it was impossible to check the natural
enjoyment which sprang up, the result of youth and
health. The clear atmosphere was so exhilarating
that the young people could not remain within doors.
Sleighing parties, tobogganing, skating on the lakes and
rivers, occupied every spare minute of the short winter
day. Shouts of merry laughter rang out on the frosty
air. All the inhabitants of the village would turn out on
fine afternoons, making their way in snowshoes down to
the icebound river, and there disporting themselves,
sometimes till the moon and stars shone out; and then
back home to the warm kitchens and the hospitable
boards.</p>

<p>“We are having a fine time of it. I never had a
finer in my life,” said young William Parkmann, as he
flew over the ice side by side with Marie Langlade.</p>

<p>“Yes, we always have a good time in winter,” she
answered; “but this year it seems better than usual,”
and she looked shyly at her companion.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear you say that,” he answered. “I
shall never forget how happy I have been; and perhaps,
Marie, when this war is over, if God spare my life, I
may come back and ask something of you!” and as
he skated close up to her, he slipped his arm into hers,
and so bore her on even more rapidly than before.
There was joy for both of them at that moment in the
mere fact of living. The sun shone brightly on the
glistening snow, which covered alike the hills and
plains, weighing down the branches of the forest trees;
but to William Parkmann Marie’s eyes shone brighter
than the rays of the sun, and her voice was very sweet,
though somewhat serious, as she answered,&#8212;</p>

<p>“When the war is over, William Parkmann&#8212;not till
then&#8212;must you ask or I answer you aught.”</p>

<p>“Let it be so,” he replied; and they skated on in
happy silence, dreams of a bright future dancing before
their eyes. They were so young&#8212;</p>

<p style='margin-left:2em;'>
“Hope at the helm<br/>
And pleasure at the prow”&#8212;</p>

<p class='ni'>they could not realise the possibility of a great disaster
coming upon them; but their elders both could and
did.</p>

<p>The head members of the settlement met every
evening, and took counsel for the general safety. To
these meetings Howe was readily admitted; they were
generally held in the great kitchen of Omega Marsh,
and Father Nathaniel presided. He knew the ways of
the Indians as well as his son, and patrols were organised,
and everything done to prevent a sudden surprise
of the enemy. He and John Cleveland and
Marcus took the command of the home brigade, as
they called it, which consisted chiefly of youths, and
of men past their prime; all the really able-bodied
men were enrolled in Roger’s corps of Rangers, and
were liable at any moment to be called into action.</p>

<p>When the meeting dispersed, Father Nat and
Brigadier Howe would open the latchet gate which
separated the two homesteads, and go over to Alpha
Marsh and sit with Martha and Loïs, who were always
busy making and mending for the two households.
Howe watched Loïs as she went and came day after
day, caring for everybody, the young and the old,
without apparently one selfish thought; and he felt
inclined to be angry with Roger for visiting upon this
inoffensive, brave-hearted woman the sorrow which
had entered into his own soul. She did not resent
his conduct; to all outward appearance she was indifferent
to his comings or his goings, doing her daily work
methodically, interested in every one and in everything,
from a sick baby in the village to the last bit of news
from Quebec or from the New England States.</p>

<p>But news did not travel quickly in those days or in
those parts, and the winter was far advanced when
they first heard of the taking of Fort William Henry
by the French. Some scouts of Roger’s arrived one
night, with an account of the frightful massacre by the
Indians which had followed the surrender of the fort.
Montcalm and the French officers had been powerless
to restrain them. The English officer, Colonel Monro,
who was in command of the fort, held out as long as
there was any hope of relief; but when General Webb
from Fort Edward failed to come to his assistance, and
he found himself on all sides surrounded by a French
army commanded by Montcalm in person, hoping
to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, he hoisted the white
flag.</p>

<p>Montcalm thereupon summoned the Indian chiefs,
and explained to them the honourable terms of capitulation
which he had agreed to, requesting their
adhesion to the same. They gave their consent,
promising to restrain their men; but no sooner had
the garrison evacuated the fort than the Indians,
drunk with rum, rushed in a surging rabble, which,
even if the French guards had exerted themselves to
their utmost&#8212;which they did not, owing either to fear
of the Indians or indifference&#8212;it would have been
impossible to restrain. A terrible scene of murder
and rapine ensued. Montcalm tried to restore tranquillity,
and by evening some sort of order reigned
in the terrified fortress, and the Canadians, under
their general, De la Corne, agreed to conduct the
English the following morning to Fort Edward.
But a panic came over the unfortunate inhabitants,
and in their terror they started without waiting for
the escort. Instantly the Indians rushed down upon
them, and an indescribable scene of plunder followed.
The savages carried off upwards of two hundred
prisoners, men and women, tomahawking and scalping
hundreds more, before the very eyes of De la Corne
and his Canadians.</p>

<p>Montcalm, Levis, and the French officers rushed down
into the midst of the fight, and, throwing themselves
upon the English, positively tore them out of the
hands of the Indians.</p>

<p>“Kill me, but spare the English, who are under
my protection!” shouted Montcalm, snatching a young
officer away from a savage who had just seized him,
and covering him with his own body.</p>

<p>Montcalm has been severely blamed for not ordering
up the regular French army to save the English; but
being very inferior in number to the Indians and
Canadians, doubtless he considered that if he turned
his arms against his allies, the massacre would be
even more sanguinary.</p>

<p>This is partly proved by the fact that the column
of the English army offered no resistance: true, they
had no ammunition; only a few of the colonial troops
had bayonets. Had they shown fight they would
probably all have been massacred; as it was, they were
carried off alive by the savages, and later Montcalm
was able to recover five or six hundred. Some of the
fugitives found their way back to the fort; and all
these were sent by Montcalm under a strong escort
to Fort Edward. The remnant of the column dispersed
into the woods, and found their way, after many days
and great perils, to Fort Edward.</p>

<p>“I am dishonoured,” said Montcalm that night,
pacing up and down his tent, brushing away the tears
from his eyes. “The sights I have seen, the sounds I
have heard this day, will haunt me all my life long!”
Nothing Chevalier Levis or his other officers could say
consoled him. He refused to see De la Corne or any
of the Canadian officers; only once he exclaimed, “If
Charles Langlade had been here, this dishonour would
not have fallen upon me!”</p>

<p>Such was the news which reached Marshwood.</p>

<p>“I must leave at once,” said Lord Howe, “and make
my way as best I can to Louisburg. Loudon
has failed in his attack on that place; but I am certain
it will be renewed without delay&#8212;therefore I will go
there.”</p>

<p>“I will take you; it is impossible for you to attempt
the journey without a proper escort; besides, we must
push forward in the same direction,” said Roger. “The
Indians have tasted blood; we shall have them swarming
by thousands all over the land.”</p>

<p>“I expect we shall,” said Howe. “When will you
be ready to start?”</p>

<p>“We are always ready,” answered Roger sternly;
“make your own preparations, and by dawn to-morrow
we will be on our way;” and having so spoken he
left the house, and was not seen again till suppertime.</p>

<p>Soon the whole settlement was astir. The indignation
of the colonists was unbounded, and they swore to
be revenged. Before nightfall upwards of three hundred
men had taken to the woods, and scouts had been
sent out in every direction to call the Rangers together.
Every precaution was taken to ensure the safety of the
settlement. Knowing they were watched, instead of
going into the woods by twenties, or even by tens, they
went forth by twos and threes, giving each other a wide
berth; but each man was acquainted with the ultimate
place of meeting; besides, though apparently dispersing,
they were within rallying distance of each other,
and knew the signal agreed upon.</p>

<p>There was quiet weeping that night in many
households. Marcus had entreated to accompany
Roger, but Martha interfered. “Not brother against
brother,” she said, clinging to him, with tears running
down her face.</p>

<p>“Stay, Marcus, my friend,” Lord Howe had said.
“It may be that you will be needed here more
than you think for; it is not well to leave Father
Nat alone without a lieutenant;” and so Marcus remained.</p>

<p>“I shall come back, Marie; don’t cry so, dear,” said
William Parkmann, ready to cry himself at sight of her
grief. “As soon as the war is over John Cleveland
shall marry us, and, darling, I’ll take you right down
to my father’s house in Boston; and you shall never
set eyes on these ugly savages again if I can help
it.” And stooping, he kissed the pretty, fair face of
his little sweetheart, as they stood together for the
last time under the great oak tree at the back of
Alpha Marsh.</p>

<p>Ah, when would those two meet again, and how?
Well might they linger side by side, the wings of their
young love drooping sadly as they gazed through the
bare branches of the great tree up to the starry
heavens. He led her back into the house, and they
parted at the foot of the staircase, he standing below
watching her, as slowly, with bowed head, she crawled
up and up out of his sight; then with a sigh he turned
away.</p>

<p>“Now I must be a man!” he said, and entered the
kitchen, where his chief, Brigadier Howe, and his companions,
with Nathaniel, Roger, and others, were in
council.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>“Roger!”</p>

<p>It was still pitch dark, at that hour between night
and morning when the light of the moon and stars is
dimmed and yet the sun has not risen. Roger had
opened the back door, and was passing out to go down
to the village, having forgotten the night before to order
three canoes to be in readiness in case of need. He
started when he heard himself called. How long had
Loïs been waiting there for him? and how could she
know he would come out?</p>

<p>“What is it you want?” he asked, in a low, hard
voice.</p>

<p>“Roger, I have been warned; you and your party are
watched. The danger is great; do not go forth.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “What nonsense, Loïs! Brigadier
Howe must go, and I must accompany him; he is my
guest. Tell your informant he must have forgotten the
laws of honour, or he would not have sent me that
message.”</p>

<p>A sigh escaped Loïs.</p>

<p>“Anything more?” he asked roughly; “if not, let
me pass.”</p>

<p>“Roger, won’t you say good-bye, maybe for the last
time? <i>He</i> was not there; <i>he</i> did not do those cruel
deeds. Oh, will you never forgive?”</p>

<p>“Never,” he answered, and passed on.</p>

<p>The first dawn of day found them all assembled in
Father Nat’s kitchen, partaking of their last meal. It
was soon over, and then a quick farewell, a silent pressure
of hand in hand, and the travellers crossed that
hospitable threshold, many of them never to return
again.</p>

<p>“God speed you. His blessing be with you all!” said
Father Nat, standing in the porch; and so they went
forth. As Lord Howe passed Loïs he took her hand,
and said gently,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Be of good courage; you will win him yet.”</p>

<p>Her face was very white, with a strained, weary
look about the soft blue eyes. A short sigh, almost
like a gasp of pain, escaped her. “Thank you,” she
said.</p>

<p>When the last of the troop had disappeared into the
wood, the women returned to their work with quiet,
animal-like patience, and Nathaniel and Marcus went
into the village with John Cleveland to see that their
orders for the proper protection of the settlement had
been carried out.</p>

<p>Striking straight across the woods, Roger and his
followers walked rapidly, but with great care, for some
miles without speaking. Their object was to escape
the redskins; and to do this they must needs mislead
them&#8212;a most difficult task. To conceal their track
they walked as lightly as possible, avoiding even
brushing against a tree, lest its bark should betray
them; winding in and out, taking a circuitous road,
and practising many other devices. They did not dare
to stop and rest even after several hours’ tramp, because
if they had lain down their bodies would necessarily
have left marks on the ground; so they went forward
till nightfall, when they found themselves on a high
open plain, where it would have been impossible for an
enemy to take them unawares. Here they rested, not
venturing even to light a fire, but eating a portion of
the dried meat, with which each man had been supplied;
and then, wrapped in their bearskins and blankets, they
slept. The following morning they started off again,
and at midday were joined by a party of their own men,
who reported that the Indians were swarming in the
woods, and were only kept at bay by the knowledge
that Roger’s Rangers were abroad.</p>

<p>“We shall have to take to the river,” said Roger;
“the banks are thickly wooded down to the very edge.
We have scouts on either bank: if the red men see us,
which they are sure to do, they will not dare attack
us.”</p>

<p>The following day three canoes were launched, into
which Roger, Howe and his companions, with two or
three of the scouts, entered, and the remainder of the
corps dispersed. Noiselessly and rapidly the canoes
were paddled forward, for some time without their
perceiving any sign betokening the presence of the
Indians. Before long they entered the vast solitudes
of the forests; a solemn silence reigned over all, broken
only by the sound of the beaver or the otter as it
plunged into the water, or the cries of the birds as
they flew from tree-top to tree-top.</p>

<p>After the second day’s journey the river gradually
narrowed, and the roots of the trees which grew down
close to the water’s edge resembled the twisted bodies
of huge serpents. Lord Howe was lying at the bottom
of the foremost canoe, whilst Roger at the head kept
a vigilant look out. Suddenly Howe saw him stoop
over the edge, plunge his hand into the water, and
draw something forth, uttering a low exclamation of
surprise.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said Howe, lifting himself up.</p>

<p>Roger did not answer immediately; his eyes were
straining into the depths of the forest; then he raised
his head and looked up to the summits of the trees,
upon the upper branches of which the sun cast its
golden light.</p>

<p>“See what I have found,” he said, bending forward
and showing Howe a thong in red leather similar to
what the Indians use for fastening on their mocassins.
“They are in front of us,” he said, with an almost
imperceptible movement of his head towards the
forest.</p>

<p>And now, as they watched, a curious thing occurred.
A couple of hundred yards in advance of them the
river was filled in by pointed rocks, over which the
water rushed with foaming rapidity; only on one
side was a narrow passage, leaving room for one or
two canoes to pass through abreast. Suddenly they
heard a loud cracking, and saw a tree slowly bend and
then fall right across this passage, the upper branches
resting on the pointed rocks.</p>

<p>“We have been betrayed,” said Roger between his
teeth. “Lie down, sir,” he said to Howe; “they will
open fire upon us.” At the same time he signed to
the rowers in his boat to stop paddling, and thus to
allow the two other canoes to draw up on either side
of his. “Lie down, all of you,” he said; “and now
paddle slowly.” At that moment a troop of Indians,
with arms shining in the sunlight and with savage
cries, dashed down the river bank, launched their
canoes, and directed them towards the three which
were floating almost motionless on the waters.</p>

<p>Lost! Assuredly they were lost!</p>

<p>They were all brave men, and had looked death
many a time before in the face; but, nevertheless, at
this supreme moment the horror of a defenceless death
overwhelmed them all.</p>

<p>“Land us, and let us at least fight it out,” said Howe.
But Roger made no answer; he understood the tactics
of his enemies. Having barred the passage, there
was nothing left for them to do but to surround and
massacre the occupants of the three canoes. They did
not even shoot at them, so certain were they of their
prey. The Indian canoes now advanced in a semicircle,
widening out, somewhat slowly, because their boats were
heavily laden. Each man had his hatchet in his hand
and his knife between his teeth, ready to slay or to scalp
his victims. By degrees the Indians approached so
close upon the three canoes that a few yards alone lay
between them and their prey; they uttered a hideous
cry of victory, which was re-echoed in the woods.</p>

<p>“Row for your lives!” said Roger suddenly. “If we
reach the tree before the Indians we are saved!”</p>

<p>Instant obedience followed his command, though to
all appearance they were going to their destruction;
the frail barks must necessarily be dashed to pieces
against the huge trunk of the tree barring their way.
Calm and immovable, his eyes fixed upon the Indian
canoes gradually coming nearer and nearer, Roger
stood ready, as it seemed, to throw himself into the
river. Indians lined the banks, but they dared not
shoot, for fear of injuring their own people. It was only
a question of seconds; their enemies must inevitably
be dashed to pieces, and then they would swim across
the stream and be in at the death. Two of the Indian
canoes in their haste knocked against each other; there
was a moment’s check. The English were within six
feet of the fatal tree. In a second it would be over.
Every man held his breath and uttered a last prayer
to God for mercy. In that second Roger had disappeared.
And then slowly but surely the tree was
lifted as by a lever, and the three canoes, driven by the
current and by the quick impulse of the rowers, passed
underneath. The Indians were close behind; but as
suddenly as it had been lifted so suddenly it fell again,
crushing beneath its weight the warriors and their
overladen barks.</p>

<p>Terrible cries arose from the woods and from the
surging waters. The evil spirits had interfered; it
was a supernatural intervention. Superstitious terror
seized the Indians, and those on land fled into the
interior of the forest. The thickness of the foliage had
prevented their seeing Roger clamber up the highest
rock and raise the tree on to his broad shoulders,
holding it there just long enough to let his friends
pass underneath.</p>

<p>In the almost unconscious excitement which followed,
the rowers had continued their course with marvellous
rapidity, forgetful of the one who had saved them,
until Howe, rising, held up his hand and bade them
cease rowing.</p>

<p>“We must wait for Roger,” he said, and his voice
was tremulous with suppressed emotion. A few minutes
later they saw him swimming towards them; every
hand was stretched out to seize his as he hoisted
himself into the canoe.</p>

<p>“I’ve cheated those devils once more,” he said, in
his rich, deep voice.</p>

<p>“It is marvellous,” answered Lord Howe. “With
God’s help you have saved us from an awful death,
Roger.”</p>

<p>“A mere question of time and strength,” he answered
carelessly. “We must keep to the river now for a few
miles, then land and take to the woods. I don’t think
we shall hear much more of the red gentlemen for
the present; they’ve had a fright,” and he laughed.
His shirt was torn to pieces, and his shoulders were
bruised and bleeding; but his companions thought
they had never seen a grander man than Roger the
Ranger!</p>

</h2>


<p>From the first General Montcalm’s position was one
of great difficulty. All the Canadian officials were
opposed to him. Their conduct was so dubious, and
would bear so little looking into, that they feared his
clear-sightedness and uprightness. Vaudreuil, the
governor, was jealous of him, and it was not long
before the General was made to feel this. False
reports concerning him were sent to the court of
France; any advantages he gained over the enemy
Vaudreuil attributed to himself and the civil government.</p>

<p>“My real crime,” Montcalm wrote to his wife, “is
to have more prestige than Vaudreuil, and, above all
things, more virtue than he has. I much fear time
will only increase his dislike of me.”</p>

<p>Montcalm’s popularity with the colonists and with
the Indians was another cause for Vaudreuil’s displeasure.
The General was incapable of dissimulation,
and as he had received full military power, he was
naturally impatient of interference, and showed it.
His second officer, Chevalier Levis, was far more
popular: he ingratiated himself with all the government
men&#8212;Vaudreuil, Bigot, Varin, etc. He knew
exactly what they were worth; but, as he observed to
Montcalm more than once, “We shall not make them
better by opposition; all we have to do is to make use
of them.” He also did what Montcalm failed to do,
courted the good graces of the ladies. When in the
camp and field, there was not a better officer, and
his devotion to his general knew no bounds; he
stood between him and his enemies, trying to conciliate
all parties; but when off duty he threw himself
into the gaieties both of Quebec and Montreal,
attending the balls and picnics, always gracious and
gallant, and therefore an immense favourite with the
fair sex.</p>

<p>Montcalm, on the contrary, held himself aloof from
all such dissipations. Notwithstanding his buoyant
nature, the opposition he met with, and the difficulties
which seemed to crowd ever thicker and thicker around
him, weighed upon his spirits, and at times caused
deep depression. He seemed to have a presentiment
that his mission would prove a failure.</p>

<p>“Ah, when shall I see my dear Candiac again, my
avenue of chestnut trees, and you, my dearest?” he
wrote in one of his letters to his wife.</p>

<p>Contrary to what might have been expected, Mercèdes
settled down to her new life under Madame
Péan’s roof easily and happily. Certain characters
have a strange admixture of good and evil in them.
Madame Péan had been early spoilt by adulation; she
lived entirely for the world and society. Her husband
was in receipt of immense sums of money, through the
influence of his commercial partners, Bigot and Varin.
His fortune was estimated at three to four millions.
His wife, therefore, could satisfy her passion for luxury,
dress and dissipation. When she proposed taking
Mercèdes into her house, during the General’s first
campaign, it had, as we know, been to get a hold over
Montcalm; but when she saw the little dark-eyed girl,
with the impetuosity of an undisciplined nature she
was taken with a sudden fondness for her, which day
by day grew more intense. Had Mercèdes been
beautiful, jealousy and rivalry might have arisen between
them; but with this simple, nun-like maiden it
was impossible. Her presence in the house gradually
became a necessity to Madame.</p>

<p>“We are supposed, all of us, to have our guardian
angels,” she said to Mercèdes one day, “and I think
you must be mine. I believe I am a better, and I am
quite sure I am a happier woman, since I have had you
beside me.”</p>

<p>The suite of rooms at the top of the house which
she had destined for Mercèdes were plain, almost
comfortless, when the latter was first introduced to
them; but before long it was converted into a perfect
nest of comfort and luxury.</p>

<p>“I don’t want all this, you know; I shall only have
a cold bare cell when I am a nun. You are spoiling
me,” said Mercèdes.</p>

<p>“It is my pleasure; indeed, my happiness,” answered
Madame. “Sacrifice yourself to me, Mercèdes, my
child. I have been spoilt and adored ever since I can
remember, but I have never cared for anything before.
Let me spoil you; it is a novel pastime.” And so
it came to pass that when the General returned to
Quebec he found Mercèdes settled; and at the first
word he uttered about her leaving, and going to the
Ursulines, Madame exclaimed,&#8212;</p>

<p>“You cannot take her away from me; she is my
guardian angel. She is of more use to me than she
would be in the convent; there she could only pray,
here she is a living example. When I see her little
figure going morning and evening across the road to
the Ursuline Chapel, I feel as if a saint had entered
my house and sanctified it. You need not fear,
Monsieur; nothing evil shall approach her, either by
word or sight. She is my almoner. Somehow she
seems to find out the poor and sick; they come to
her, and she and Marthe are now familiar figures in
the back streets and poor quarters of Quebec. ‘The
little nun, the good General’s daughter,’ she is called.
What would you have more? Let her do her work:
it is a blessed work. She never appears at my grand
receptions. She knows nothing of <i>our</i> world; but
when I am weary I go up to her, and it is as if I
breathed a new life. I am better for it. Leave her
under my roof, General; she is in the world, but not
of it.”</p>

<p>Still the General hesitated. He knew now that much
that went on at Madame Péan’s was contrary to his
ideas, and in direct opposition to his and his wife’s
code of morals; but the Chevalier Levis added his persuasions
to Madame’s.</p>

<p>“You will give mortal offence if you remove her,”
he said; “and surely you have enemies enough already.
It is quite true what Madame says: Mademoiselle
Mercèdes lives a life utterly apart from hers. She is
never seen in the <i>salons</i> of the Intendance, and only
appears when it is a quiet home party. You can judge
for yourself.”</p>

<p>And the General did so. His happiest moments
during his short stay in Quebec were spent in
Mercèdes’ rooms, the windows of which looked upon
the convent gardens, where the silent nuns were pacing
up and down the paths, turning their backs, with
their heavy sable coiffures sweeping their black robes,
and anon their still, mask-like faces, set in that stiff
framework of white linen, towards these windows; and
he felt almost relieved to keep his Mercèdes a little
longer a free agent; she looked so happy and so
well, as she stood beside him in the little greenery
which Madame Péan had created for her of house
plants, tall geraniums, an over-arching ivy, and delicate
roses.</p>

<p>“You are content to remain here, Mercèdes?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Only too content,” she answered. “I try always to
remember it is but for a time, and because she wants
me; and I look across the road and know that my true
home is there.”</p>

<p>“And you have no regrets for the world you will
leave behind, Mercèdes?” he asked.</p>

<p>She turned her head slightly on one side, so that the
General could not see the colour which mantled her
face.</p>

<p>“I think not,” she answered quietly. “Why should
I?”</p>

<p>And so, when the General left her for the winter campaign,
it was an understood thing that for the present
at least she was to remain with Madame Péan. Events
followed so rapidly&#8212;defeats, victories, hair-breadth
escapes&#8212;that, feeling she was in safe keeping, the
General had no time to be even anxious about
Mercèdes; and so she led a strange though by no
means an unhappy life in that upper story. Both her
and Marthe’s time was spent working and fashioning
clothes for the poor; for, alas! only too quickly the
poverty and distress grew to be severe. Bread rose to
an exorbitant price; meat there was none save horseflesh.
At least, so Mercèdes saw and heard in her
visits among the poor; but at Madame Péan’s table
there was every luxury both in and out of season. She
remarked upon this more than once, and was told she
must not be too credulous, the poor were so improvident!
At Montreal everything was at famine price, and the
public indignation was so great against the government
that the populace mobbed the Governor, the troops
joining in the mutiny, and it was with difficulty that
Chevalier Levis, by his authority and tact, succeeded
in quelling the rebellion.</p>

<p>Occasionally, at rare intervals, Mercèdes and Charles
Langlade met. Often months elapsed between these
interviews; then suddenly at the corner of a street,
or maybe as she rose from her knees after service in
the cathedral, Mercèdes would become aware of the
Canadian hunter’s presence. He would salute her,
enquire after her well-being, and walk with her and
Marthe part of the homeward way; but at the door
they parted.</p>

<p>One day, as Charles Langlade was still standing
cap in hand looking after Mercèdes’ retreating figure,
Madame Péan’s coach drove up. A light came into
her eyes, and she hastened to descend. “At last,”
she murmured, and going quickly up to the young
officer, she said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Monsieur Langlade, why are you such a stranger?
Major Péan was speaking only yesterday of your
services, how inestimable they are. Will you not
come in and partake of supper? We happen to be
almost alone to-night, and our little nun will then
come out of her shell. You and she are great friends,
if I mistake not.”</p>

<p>“You honour me too much, Madame,” answered
Charles. “I am but a poor hunter, a chief among
savages. I can scarcely venture to call myself the
friend of my illustrious General’s daughter. When,
as now, I have been with her father, if I happen to meet
her, I give her news of him&#8212;that is all.”</p>

<p>Madame looked at him steadily for a minute, then
said, “But you will come in to supper?” He shook
his head, bowed low, and was gone. And Mercèdes
from her window, looking down, watched the tall figure
as it strode up the street, and at last disappeared.
These interviews made her feel strangely bright and
happy, and she gradually grew to look forward to them.
She knew that he was her father’s right hand, that, so
to speak, he kept guard upon all the country for many
miles round Quebec down the St. Lawrence. The
General himself had told her that, out of his own army,
there was no one he trusted like Charles Langlade and
the tribe he commanded.</p>

<p>Events were crowding upon each other; and the
General knew full well that unless France came to his
assistance, England must gain the mastery. Pitt was
determined to win and to carry on the colonisation
of the continent under the auspices of Protestantism,
rather than allow France leagued with the Roman
Catholics to gain the ascendency. His policy was
popular; he invited the colonies to co-operate willingly,
and entirely rejected the coercive policy of his predecessors.
He was eminently successful; and whilst
Montcalm wrote in 1758, “New France needs peace,
or sooner or later it must fall&#8212;such are the numbers
of the English, such the difficulty of our receiving
supplies,” the colonies were making immense sacrifices
to levy, pay, and clothe the provincial army.</p>

<p>Massachusetts set a noble example; she was the
frontier and advance-guard of all the colonies against
the enemy. Notwithstanding the extreme poverty of
her population, which lived mainly by fishing, farming,
and a trade hampered by the British navigation laws,
she still imposed taxes to the amount of thirteen
shillings in the pound, and there was no murmuring.
The war gradually assumed almost the character of a
crusade, and was viewed with religious enthusiasm.
All sects for the time being sank their differences, and
the chaplains exhorted their congregations to unite
together, themselves setting the example of good
fellowship.</p>

<p>“Be courageous, for no cowards go to heaven,”
said Dr. Caleb Rea, chaplain of a Massachusetts regiment,
in his last sermon to a young band of volunteers;
and they went forth, like the Puritans of old, singing
hymns and psalms.</p>

<p>The Canadian population were not less desirous of
supporting Montcalm and maintaining their independence;
but they had two parties to contend with,
the civil and military government, between whom
there was no union. Besides which, vice, luxury, and
an exorbitant love of gain were rampant among those
who ought to have set the example of moderation and
self-sacrifice; and thus their resources were undermined.
In vain Montcalm applied to the mother
country for help, despatching Bougainville to represent
the state of affairs to the Court at Versailles; but
the sins which were to cause the loss of Canada
were in full force there; and to Bougainville’s earnest
pleading he received for answer, “Eh, Monsieur, when
the house is on fire, one cannot occupy one’s self with
the stable.”</p>

<p>And so the French officer returned sadly to Canada
and gave this message. Montcalm recognised that
from henceforth he was forsaken by the Court, and
could reckon only upon God’s mercy and his own
genius and courage.</p>

<p>“Poor king, poor France, <i>cara patria</i>,” was his only
answer; and he prepared for what he knew to be an
almost hopeless struggle.</p>

</h2>


<p>When Roger had conducted Lord Howe to within
a comparatively safe distance of his destination,
he left him to pursue his journey in company with
another party of scouts, who were going in that
direction, whereas Roger was anxious to gain the mountains
on the western shore of Lake Champlain, where
he foresaw a struggle would shortly take place.</p>

<p>“We shall meet probably at Ticonderoga, or thereabouts,”
said Howe, as he wrung Roger’s hand at
parting.</p>

<p>He left the three young officers, Philips, Pringle,
and Roche, with Roger, to complete their apprenticeship,
he said; but William Parkmann accompanied Howe.
The young man’s devotion to his general was such
that he was never happy away from him. And truly
Howe was a man worthy of the affection which he won
at every stage of his short career. A very Spartan in
private and public life, a Christian in word and deed,
a character of ancient times, and a model of military
virtue: such was he. Of him, Wolfe, his great contemporary,
said, “He is the noblest gentleman who
has appeared in my time, and the best soldier in the
British army.”</p>

<p>Regretfully Roger saw Howe depart. They had lived
together for many months, and each appreciated the
other. Howe grieved for the sorrow and the bitterness
which had come into the young hunter’s life; but he
hoped and believed time would soften the rebellious
temper which made him visit so unjustly Charles
Langlade’s offence upon innocent heads. “If you go
back to Marshwood, remember me at both Alpha and
Omega,” he said at parting; and so each went his way.</p>

<p>The news of Roger’s last deed of prowess had spread
rapidly. The Indians attributed it to the power of the
spirits, but the Canadians knew better. When Charles
Langlade heard the story, a feeling of pride filled his
heart, almost of regret that he had not been with him&#8212;his
friend, his brother; but Roger and his Rangers had
now assumed such importance that they were looked
upon as representing a greater danger than the regular
forces.</p>

<p>Understanding Indian warfare, with a perfect knowledge
of the whole country, led by a fearless leader,
if they were not kept in check or crushed the results
would certainly be of such a nature as to threaten the
free action of the French and Canadian armies. It
was therefore decided in a council of war that an
expedition of Indians and Canadians should be sent to
meet the Rangers, and, if possible, stop their progress.
Charles Langlade saw the necessity and justice of the
step, but naturally he was loth to take part in it, and
would gladly have remained in the neighbourhood of
Quebec; but his knowledge of the country where the
New England Rangers were likely at the present
moment to be was a reason for his being called to
command the expedition sent against them. In all
honour he could not hold back; he had cast in his lot
with France, and he must needs stand steadfast to the
bitter end.</p>

<p>This war resembled in many ways a civil war&#8212;of all
afflictions which can visit a country the most terrible!
Father against son, brother against brother, the crushing
beneath one’s feet of every domestic tie&#8212;a moral
agony from first to last. Rome and Alba, the Horatii
and Curiatii, the Wars of the Roses and the great
English civil war of the seventeenth century, stand out
in the history of the world as times of sore distress and
anguish. Blood flowed freely. Some of the best and
noblest in the land were laid low; but who reckons the
women’s tears of blood, the agony of those hearts torn
with divided affections? Fathers and husbands, brothers
and lovers, drawing their swords against each other&#8212;truly
it needed an Amazonian nature to love a country
which demanded such sacrifices. The great French poet
Corneille understood the natural weakness of a woman’s
heart when he pictured Camille, the sister of Horace,
kneeling over her dead lover’s body, cursing Rome and
the arm that had laid him low. So let us ever pray
for peace at home and abroad, the peace which reigned
on earth when the Saviour was born, and which we
believe He will bring with Him at His second coming.</p>

<p>It was with a heavy heart that Charles Langlade,
true to his sense of duty, took the command of
the Indian and Canadian contingent, and set out to
meet the Rangers, passing up the valley of Trout
Brook, a mountain gorge that opens upon the valley
of Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>After leaving Howe, Roger had rejoined his men at
the west point of the mountain known as “Roger’s
Rock,” thus named from an exploit in which he had
outwitted the Indians and saved his own and comrades’
lives when still a mere youth. The rough and rocky
ground was still partially covered with snow, and all
around stood the grey trunks of the forest trees, bearing
aloft their skeleton arms, a tangled intricacy of leafless
twigs.</p>

<p>Here Roger encamped, knowing full well that the
Indians were in the neighbourhood; but the spot had
natural advantages. Close on the right was a steep
hill, and at a little distance on the left a brook still
partially covered with snow and ice. He sent scouts out
into the woods, and several skirmishes took place; but
he did not believe that at this point the Indians were
in any considerable force. He therefore determined to
rid himself of these enemies by pushing them farther
back, and, being informed through his scouts of the
arrival of a reinforcement from one of the Iroquois
tribes, he judged it would be best to attack them at once.</p>

<p>Desiring Lieutenant Philips to remain in the rear,
he himself advanced through a mountain pass, at the
farther extremity of which a party of Indians were
encamped. He took them by surprise, and after a short
but desperate skirmish they fled before him. Determined
to drive them farther off, he pursued them,
when suddenly with a loud war-whoop they turned
upon him, and from the surrounding forest Indians
came pouring down on him and his company. Philips
hurried to the rescue; but the little force was overwhelmed
by numbers, and eight officers, beside a
hundred Rangers, lay dead in the snow.</p>

<p>The young lieutenants Pringle and Roche fought
beside Roger.</p>

<p>“There is nothing left but for you to escape into the
mountains,” he said at last. “Make your way through
the forest to Fort Edward. Do you see there to the left
a narrow pass? Escape whilst you can; in five minutes
it will be too late. I am responsible for your lives.”</p>

<p>“Where you go, we go,” said Pringle.</p>

<p>They were crouching with some twenty men behind
a clump of trees firing upon the savages, but their
ammunition was running short. Philips in his turn
was being overwhelmed. From every part of the forest
the redskins came pouring down.</p>

<p>“It is of no use; we must run for it,” said Roger.
“Load once more, and when I say ‘fire’ give it them
all together; then up the pass and into the mountains:
it is our only chance.”</p>

<p>He was obeyed. They poured a volley of shot into
the ranks of the savages, who fell back for a second;
and before they had recovered themselves or the smoke
had cleared away, Roger and a score of his companions
were in full flight. To keep together was impossible;
the Indians harassed them on every side. They scaled
mountains, forded streams, and at last, by nightfall,
Roger, with a handful of followers, had out-distanced
his pursuers and lay hidden in a cave; but, to his
distress, Pringle, Roche, and his own faithful servant,
William Smith, were missing.</p>

<p>They had no food, and lay all night on the bare
ground. When day dawned they crept out, only to
find traces of the enemy all around. Still it was
impossible to remain in the cave.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Roger, “there is only one way of
escape. Once, as you all know, when a mere lad I
scaled yonder mountain. On the opposite side there is
a precipice; it is perpendicular, and the chances are ten
to one of breaking your neck in the descent. I prefer
that to being tomahawked. I advise no one to follow
me. The Indians, who are on the watch, will be sure to
see me, and that will make a diversion in your favour.
If I succeed, once on the other side, I shall have little
difficulty in reaching Fort Edward. My presence
amongst you rather adds to than takes from the
danger of your position. They know I am here, and
Roger’s scalp is, it seems, worth having. We will go
forth together, and make a run for it, till we come to
the foot of Roger’s Mountain; then I will turn off and
begin the ascent. The Indians are sure to follow me.
Let them. I think I know a dodge or two to keep them
at bay. You, in the meantime, take to the woods. If
you get well in and across to the other side you may
escape, but as long as I am with you your chances are
small; they are after me, and will not lose my track.
Are you all agreed?”</p>

<p>They answered in the affirmative. Two or three were
for accompanying Roger, but he dissuaded them.</p>

<p>“You would but hamper my movements,” he said,
“and probably come to grief. I know every inch of
the mountain, but you do not; you run less risk in
keeping together; and if I can get round in time I
may muster a band and come to your help. I wonder
what has become of Philips?”</p>

<p>Alas! like many others, the brave young lieutenant
had been cruelly murdered.</p>

<p>Moving in and out of the forest, dodging the
Indians in every possible way, the little party at last
reached the foot of the mountain, grey and bare, its
summit rising to the clouds.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a shout, Roger was seen scaling it.
To follow him was the natural instinct of the savages.
He let them for a time; then suddenly he turned
round and fired down upon them. Several fell, but,
nothing daunted, they responded. Gradually, as the
ascent grew more and more precipitous, they dropped
off, and the last they saw of Roger was standing on the
edge of what they knew to be a fathomless precipice.
They saw him throw himself forward and disappear
from their sight. Half-way up the mountain they
discovered his bearskin, which he must have thrown
off, and they carried it back in triumph. Its owner was
doubtless lying dashed to pieces in the abyss.</p>

<p>His companions had followed his advice, and most
of them managed in the course of two or three days
to reach Lake St. George, and from thence Fort
Edward. The young lieutenants Pringle and Roche
fared the worst. Separated from their party, they got
hopelessly lost in the woods. In the brushwood, among
the low branches of the trees, their clothes were soon
reduced to rags. They had no food except a small
portion of dried sausage and a little ginger. After two
days’ and two nights’ wandering they had nothing to
subsist upon but juniper berries and the inner bark
of trees. They fell in with Roger’s own servant,
William Smith, by whose help they made snowshoes
of forked branches, twigs, and leather strings; for their
feet were torn to pieces and half-frozen. The three
struggled on together, wandering over nameless mountains,
climbing over fallen trees, until on the sixth
day they discovered that they had circled round to
their starting-point! But at least now they knew their
bearings, and they reached the bank of Lake St. George.
Here suddenly a heavy snowstorm arose. They
dared not stop; so, bending their heads to the storm,
they fought their way forward into the valley of
Ticonderoga, not eight miles distant from the French
fort. In the struggle Pringle had lost his gun, and
almost his life; they determined therefore to surrender.
Night found them once more in the forest. Here,
utterly exhausted, William Smith became delirious,
laid down, and died. To keep their blood in motion,
and fearful lest if they moved backwards or forwards
they should once more lose themselves in the depths
of the forest, the two officers walked all night round
and round a tree! In the morning, half-dead, they
made for the French fort. When they came in sight
of it, they hoisted a white handkerchief. Instantly
two or three French officers dashed forward and saved
them from the Indians, who had almost laid hands
upon them.</p>

<p>They were conducted to the fort as prisoners of war,
and kindly treated and tended. Later on they were
exchanged.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&#8212;Pringle died in 1800, senior Major-General
of the British army.</p>

</h2>


<p>“There’s a man asking for you, sir!” said a servant
to Lord Howe, as he sat in the verandah of his
friend Colonel Schuyler’s house in Albany.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day at the end of May. Winter had
given place to a sudden burst of spring, or rather early
summer. The woods were rich with green foliage; sunshine
bathed the land, giving promise of a rich harvest
of grains and fruit, which in this climate ripen almost
as quickly as they spring forth from mother earth.</p>

<p>“A man asking for me?” said Lord Howe. “What
sort of man?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, he’s rather rough-looking: a border man,
I should say,” answered the servant.</p>

<p>“Better show him up here,” said Colonel Schuyler.
“In these times one has to deal with such a queer
lot.”</p>

<p>Howe nodded assent, and the servant disappeared.
The General rose and went over to where his hostess,
Madame Schuyler, sat in a low rocking-chair, somewhat
apart from the men, gazing sadly over the town and
country. She and Lord Howe were great friends. He
had been a guest in this hospitable home for several
weeks, and both husband and wife had become deeply
attached to him.</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of, Madame?” said Howe.</p>

<p>She looked up at him with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I was thinking,” she answered, in a low voice,
“that soon you will be leaving us. Will you ever come
back again?”</p>

<p>“That is as God wills,” said Howe reverently. “Why
trouble? Life and death are in His hands, not in ours.
The great call may come to me here in your happy
home as quickly as on the battle-field. I never feel
nearer death there than elsewhere.”</p>

<p>Before she could answer him, a quick step was heard
on the verandah. Howe turned round.</p>

<p>“Roger!” he exclaimed, holding out both his hands.</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve turned up again,” said the hunter, as he
returned the greeting. “I suppose, like others, you
reckoned I had taken my last leap?”</p>

<p>“I did indeed,” answered Howe. “You are almost
like one come back to us from the dead. Let me
introduce you to my friends, and then tell us how it
happens that you are now standing before us alive,
and, what is still more wonderful, sound of limb, if I
mistake not!” and he looked at his friend critically
from head to foot.</p>

<p>Roger threw his head back and laughed. “Yes,
there are no broken bones,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said Howe, turning to Madame Schuyler,
“allow me to present you to a man I am proud to call
my friend, ‘Roger the Ranger.’”</p>

<p>“The name is enough,” said the Colonel, coming up.
“The whole country is alive with the story of your
exploits; but your <i>last</i> beats them all. Do your
Rangers know of your escape, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I joined a party of my men as soon as possible,
but purposely kept quiet for some time,” answered
Roger. “Though not wounded, I was frightfully
bruised; sliding down that rock was no small matter.
I was more dead than alive when I got to the bottom,
and had two or three ugly cuts. I believe I must have
lain unconscious for several hours. When I gathered
myself together I could hardly drag my limbs. I had
to remain hidden in the forest for upwards of a week,
living on juniper berries and anything I could pick
up; fortunately the less a man gets to eat in a case
like mine the better. I knew of a stream, and was
able to get fresh water; so by degrees the fever went
down, and I crawled to Fort Edward. I gave them a
startler there; they thought it was my ghost.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what has become of Philips?” asked
Lord Howe.</p>

<p>“Murdered,” answered Roger shortly. “Pringle
and Roche are prisoners of the French, but they are
well treated, and will in all probability be exchanged
before long. Where’s William Parkmann? Gone
home?”</p>

<p>“No fear of that,” answered Howe; “he is my
faithful esquire, and will not leave me. He has just
gone down the town, but he will be back before long.
He has been in terrible trouble about you. Of course
at the Marshes they know you are safe? You’ve taken
care of that?”</p>

<p>“Yes; as soon as I was able I sent a party of men
to let them know,” answered Roger; “but it was a
good two months after the mishap. However, fortunately,
news travels slowly out there, and it was
some weeks before they knew anything especial had
happened; and as they are pretty well accustomed to
my hair-breadth escapes, they were not over-ready to
believe the rumour of my death. However, the assurance
that I was alive and well was none the less welcome.”</p>

<p>“I should rather think not,” said Madame Schuyler;
“but do you really consider it safe for your family to
remain in such an out-of-the-way place? Every day
we hear of villages and settlements burnt and pillaged.
At least, it seems to me it would be better for your
womankind if they came into a city for protection.”</p>

<p>“I have no womankind,” said Roger sternly, looking
straight before him, so as to avoid Lord Howe’s eye;
“and no power on earth would drag my father away
from the Marshes as long as there is one stone left upon
another. The settlement is large and well defended.
I should say they ran less danger than most of the
border villages; and, in any case, it would not do for
the heads to take flight.”</p>

<p>“But at Alpha Marsh they are only women,” said
Lord Howe.</p>

<p>“Marcus is there; he must decide. I have no word
in the matter,” said Roger, turning away to greet
William Parkmann.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening, to Roger’s annoyance,
the danger to the colonists on the border was again
discussed.</p>

<p>“My father has offered to send an escort to bring
Mistress Langlade and her daughters to Boston,” said
William Parkmann; “but neither Loïs nor her mother
will move, and of course the younger girls will not
leave them. Surely you might use your influence and
represent to them the risk they are running,” he said,
turning to Roger.</p>

<p>“I have no influence,” was the stony answer. “My
father and Marcus will do all that can be done to
protect them; besides, as I told you before, I hardly
think the Indians will attack the Marshes. Their
chief has surely power enough to protect his own
people!”</p>

<p>“I doubt it; besides, Langlade cannot be everywhere,”
said Howe; “and the Indians will owe you a worse
grudge than ever now. Be warned, Roger, and send
word for the women to be sent to Boston.”</p>

<p>“If I did, Loïs would not obey me,” he said slowly.
Neither Lord Howe nor William Parkmann had ever
heard him pronounce her name before. “He who
ought to have been there to defend his own has forsaken
them; can she do likewise?” he added, turning
away with an angry gesture.</p>

<p>“There is nothing for it, William,” said Howe gently,
“but to leave them in God’s hands and trust to His
mercy.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Madame Schuyler,” said William Parkmann
to their hostess, “if you could only see my pretty
Marie! She is like a white lily. To think of those
savages approaching her is agony.”</p>

<p>“Try and not think of it,” said the lady gently.
“Surely their brother will take care they are not
molested?”</p>

<p>“He cannot prevent the tribes making raids on the
settlements,” said Lord Howe; “and, besides, I have
heard that Montcalm keeps him as much as he can
with him. It is St. Luc de la Corne and Nivernelle
who were at the head of the late expeditions. But here
comes Roger; better say nothing more at present.”</p>

<p>The next few weeks were spent in hard, matter-of-fact
preparation for the coming campaign. Roger’s
Rangers came from all parts, and gathered round him
a stronger force than ever, delighted to have once more
found their leader, and prouder than ever of his exploits.
They were to take up their position on Lake St. George,
and to drive Montcalm from several advantageous positions
he held there, more especially from the plateau
of Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear lady, we shall part to-morrow,” said Lord
Howe, the eve of the day fixed for the departure of the
army. “I have come to bid you farewell and to thank
you for my happy holiday. I trust before many weeks
are over to return to you victorious. Everything is in
our favour; we have a splendid army, 6367 officers and
soldiers, regulars, and 9054 colonial troops.”</p>

<p>“If they are well disciplined, I wonder who is to
thank for it!” said Madame Schuyler significantly.</p>

<p>“Certainly not Mrs. Nabby-Cromby, the ‘Aged
One,’”<sup>[1]</sup> said William Parkmann, who had accompanied
Howe, on his farewell visit.</p>

<p class='fn'>[Footnote 1: This nickname was generally applied to Abercromby
throughout the army, though he was only fifty-two years of age; but he was
incapable and infirm.]</p>

<p>“Whatever may be your private opinion, it would
be more agreeable to me if you would express yourself,
when speaking of our General-in-Chief, more respectfully,”
said Lord Howe severely.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” said William Parkmann, who knew
full well that the least breach of discipline was an
unpardonable offence in the eyes of his leader.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Howe was in reality the soul of the
expedition; the soldiers were devoted to him, and ready
to follow him to the death. Yet he was a strict disciplinarian.
He had brought to bear upon the army
all the experience he had gathered during his months
of forest warfare under Roger. He made the men
under his command dress according to their work.
The coats of both regulars and provincials were cut
short at the waist; they wore leggings to protect them
from the briers. He did away with the long hair
which was still the fashion in the English army. All
these details would have rendered many men unpopular;
but in Howe’s case it had the contrary effect: the
sweetness of his temper, his own personal example, and
the excessive charm of his manner carried all before
him. With the exception of the few weeks he had
been persuaded to spend with the Schuylers whilst in
the neighbourhood of Albany, he lived in camp with
his men, simply and roughly, sharing their hardships,
and, one and all, they appreciated his self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, though you are too modest to care to
hear it, what William Parkmann says is true,” said
Madame Schuyler. “Without you there would be
neither order nor discipline in the army. If anything
were to happen to you, there would be an end to all
things.”</p>

<p>“We might throw down our arms at once,” said
William Parkmann. “General Montcalm would have
a fine chance.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’s a man I’m so sorry for as that
man, though he be our enemy!” said Howe. “But for
him we should walk over the ground. He’s a splendid
general, and is holding his own against desperate odds,
Vaudreuil is jealous of him, and thwarts him at every
step; and the other Canadian officials are thieves and
robbers. If Montcalm held all the power in his own
hands, and was properly seconded, we should have but
little chance; as it is he may yet win!”</p>

<p>“You don’t really think he will?” said Madame
Schuyler.</p>

<p>“No, I do not,” answered Howe; “but still he is
a splendid fellow, and as long as he holds Quebec he
is master of Canada. If he were <i>sole</i> master, then I
should say the odds were for him and against us. And
now, dear lady, farewell. I have still much to see
to to-night, and to-morrow at daybreak we shall start.
Never doubt but what as we pass by I shall look
upwards to your white house on these sunny upland
meadows, and think of the happy hours I have spent
here, and the dear friends I leave behind.”</p>

<p>“Farewell, and God be with you,” said Madame
Schuyler, her voice choked with tears, as she gave him
her hand; he bent for a second over it.</p>

<p>“God bless you and yours,” he said; then he turned
away, ran down the terrace, and disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>William Parkmann hastened to follow his chief’s
example; but as he took leave of Madame Schuyler he
said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“You need not fear for him; he is so beloved; we
all keep watch and ward over him.”</p>

<p>“It will be of no avail,” she answered sadly. “I
saw him last night in a dream, lying dead in the long
green grass;” and, turning away to hide her emotion,
she slowly re-entered the house.</p>

<h2 id='chXVII' title='XVII—THROUGH THE FOREST'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XVII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.1em'>THROUGH THE FOREST</span>
</h2>


<p>It was the 5th of July, 1758. The sun shone forth
in all his glory, gilding the mountain tops and
lighting up the deepest valleys. The English and
Colonial troops had embarked the previous evening on
nine hundred troop-boats; a hundred and thirty-five
whale-boats and a large number of flat boats carried the
artillery.</p>

<p>It was a superb spectacle, never forgotten by those
who witnessed it, when the boats filed forth and entered
the narrows, a long line extending for six miles. The
flash of oars and glitter of weapons, the banners,
the varied uniforms, the notes of the bugle, the bagpipes,
trumpets, and drums, prolonged by a hundred
woodland echoes, enhanced the brightness of the summer
day and the romantic beauty of the scenery.
The sheen and sparkle of the crystal waters, the countless
islets tufted with pine, birch, and fir, the bordering
mountains, with their green summits and sunny crags,
united to impress this scene upon the minds of all
present.</p>

<p>“I never beheld such a delightful prospect,” wrote
an eye-witness to his friends at home. There was
something triumphant in it; and the spirits of both
men and officers responded to the general impression.
The boats advanced rapidly down Lake St. George,
and it was still daylight when they halted to await
the baggage and artillery, which were in the rear.
After sunset they started afresh, and by daybreak the
next morning had reached the end of the lake.</p>

<p>Here they became aware that they were being
watched by an advance party of the French. Roger
immediately landed with his company of Rangers,
and drove the enemy back into the wood, after which
the whole army went on shore. A council of officers
was then called, of whom Howe and Roger were the
leading spirits.</p>

<p>When the council was over the two men lay side
by side on their outstretched bearskins resting. The
scene was lovely. A plain covered with forest stretched
half a mile or more to the mountains, behind which
lay Trout Brook, whilst ruddy in the warm sunrise rose
the vast bare face of Roger’s Rock.</p>

<p>“I marvel how you did it!” said Lord Howe to his
companion.</p>

<p>“It looks worse than it really is,” answered Roger.
“One only needs a steady head, a good eye for distances,
and a firm foot. Nevertheless, I should not
care to try it again. And now what is to be our next
move? Langy and his French have retreated to the
woods. He will probably join Montcalm at the Saw Mills
up by the falls. My advice is to cross the forest,
dislodge the French, and make for Ticonderoga. I know
positively that Montcalm’s army only numbers a fourth
of ours; of course, Levis may bring up reinforcements,
but at present he is at Montreal, and Vaudreuil may,
and probably will, think proper to detain him there.
It is for us to advance without delay.”</p>

<p>“Then let us do it at once!” said Lord Howe,
springing up; and, going to the group of officers, he
imparted Roger’s opinion to them.</p>

<p>It was immediately decided that the Royal Rangers
should take to the woods under Roger, and that
Lord Howe and Major Putman should follow with
two hundred Rangers and scouts, the remainder of
the army in four separate columns bringing up the
rear.</p>

<p>In less than an hour the plan was carried into effect;
and soon through the silent primeval forest an army
was groping its way, buried in foliage so thick that
no sound of waggons or artillery could be heard, only
“the cawing of the crows, flapping their black wings
over the sea of tree-tops.” The forest was dense; the
way was obstructed by undergrowth, and it was impossible
to see the fallen trees which lay about in every
stage of decay. The sun, even when at its height,
could hardly pierce the canopy of boughs. Roger, who
was in advance, was himself fairly puzzled; but he
knew the direction he had to take, and was able to
guide his men, fully believing Howe was on the same
track; and so in truth he was, only at a greater distance
than Roger had supposed. Suddenly Lord Howe and
those nearest to him heard voices close upon them,
and recognised that they were French. They checked
their advance and listened.</p>

<p>“We are caught in an ambush,” said Lord Howe,
“or else it is the advance party under Langy who
are in retreat, and have lost their way. One thing is
in our favour: in the darkness they cannot recognise
friend from foe. We must try to push through them.
Let no man speak. If they challenge us the word is
‘Français.’ I’ll give it!”</p>

<p>He was right in his surmise. It was Langy with his
three hundred and fifty men who had got lost in the
woods, and now found themselves in the very centre
of the English army, dividing it, so to speak, Roger
and the Royal Rangers in front, Howe and the remainder
of the English army behind. For a few
minutes the two armies were mingled, until a suspicion
of the truth dawned on the French.</p>

<p>“<i>Qui vive?</i>” shouted Langy.</p>

<p>“<i>Français!</i>” came from the English; but Langy
was not deceived. A volley of musketry was the
immediate answer. William Parkmann, who was close
beside Howe, saw by the flash of the muskets his chief
stagger. He caught him in his arms, and carried
him out of the ranks. Alas! in that second the
noble spirit had winged its flight to another world.
Those nearest him had seen him fall, and the ill news
spread like wild-fire. A sort of panic seized the soldiers.
They believed they had fallen into an ambush, and
that Montcalm’s whole force was upon them; but
fortunately the Rangers stood firm and fought steadily.
The sound of the musketry reached Roger. A faint
inkling of the truth dawned upon him, and without
hesitation he turned round and took the French
in the rear. Thus, between two fires, their position
was desperate. Nevertheless, they fought with unrivalled
bravery, and of the three hundred and fifty
men of Langy’s corps, fifty only escaped: one hundred
and sixty were made prisoners; the remainder being
killed or drowned in trying to cross the rapids. The
English had lost comparatively few men. But Howe’s
death was an irreparable disaster. “The death of
this one man,” a contemporary observes, “was the
ruin of fifteen thousand!” The soul of Abercromby’s
army expired with this young officer; an almost general
languor crept over the men. Order and discipline
became lax. Abercromby himself seemed paralysed.
Montcalm had retreated to the base of the peninsula
upon which Ticonderoga stands, and had intrenched
himself there.</p>

<p>The peninsula of Ticonderoga consists of a rocky
plateau, with low grounds on each side, bordering Lake
Champlain on the one hand, and the outlet of Lake
St. George on the other. A ridge is formed across
the plateau. Montcalm decided to defend this ridge
by abattis. Men and officers worked together, making
a barricade of trees eight or nine feet high; every
tree in the neighbourhood was hewn down as if laid
flat by a hurricane.</p>

<p>Abercromby, fearing Montcalm’s position would be
further strengthened by reinforcements, ordered an
immediate attack; but he himself remained at the Mill,
a mile and a half away in the rear. The English were
therefore virtually without a leader, and nothing was left
them in the coming struggle but blind, headlong valour.
As they advanced to the attack they could see the top
of the breastwork, but not the men who fought behind
it; and when they attempted to penetrate through the
breastwork, or climb over it, they were stopped by
sharpened branches and by a cross fire which poured
down upon them. The French fought with intrepid
gaiety, shouting, “Long live our King! Long live our
General!” Montcalm, with his coat off, was everywhere.
Six times the English returned to the attack.
Campbell Duncan, laird of Inveraw, belonging to the
42nd regiment, called the “Black Watch,” with others
jumped down the abattis into the midst of the French,
and were killed, bayoneted.</p>

<p>The English lost nineteen hundred men and forty-four
officers; the French three hundred and seventy-seven;
but their officers Bourlamaque and Bougainville were
both wounded, while Levis, who came up at the end,
had his hat twice shot through. Abercromby was at
last obliged to retreat, and Ticonderoga remained in the
hands of the French. Montcalm, in gratitude to God
for having given him the victory over so brave an
enemy, erected a cross on the spot.</p>

<p>Roger and his Rangers had taken no active part in
the attack upon Ticonderoga; the loss of Howe hung
like a heavy cloud over them. Roger, with Putman,
had remained in the woods, keeping up a border
warfare, pursuing the French and shooting any who
came in his way; and they pursued these tactics so
persistently and aggressively that the French at last
openly attacked the Rangers. With the aid of the
Indians, they succeeded in taking Putman prisoner.
He was, however, rescued from the hands of the
Indians by a French officer, and conveyed under escort
to Ticonderoga, where Montcalm received him and
treated him with kindness. Here he made friends
with Colonel Schuyler, who was also a prisoner, and
together they lamented the death of their friend.</p>

<p>This victory was to be the last great success of the
French. Slowly but surely they were being pushed back
upon their great fortress, the key of Canada: Quebec.
Still there was no thought of surrender&#8212;Montcalm
stood firm at the helm.</p>

<h2 id='chXVIII' title='XVIII—NADJII'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XVIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.1em'>NADJII</span>
</h2>


<p>The first grey light of morning was creeping
through the white curtains of Loïs’ bedroom,
where she was still sleeping, when suddenly, without
any apparent reason, she awoke and sat straight
up.</p>

<p>“I am certain I heard something or some one,” she
said to herself, and bent forward to listen. For a
few seconds there was silence, save for the twitter of
the awakening birds; then there came a slight rattling
on the window-pane, as if earth or dust had been
thrown.</p>

<p>“I knew I was right,” said Loïs. She got out of
bed, slipped on a wrapper, and, bare-footed as she was,
went softly across the room to the window; this she
opened noiselessly and bent forward. What a lovely
autumn morning it was, the air so fresh and full
of vitality! The many-tinted leaves of the creepers
clambering up the house thrust themselves forward,
kissing Loïs’ cheek as if to wish her “good
morrow.”</p>

<p>It was scarcely three o’clock. A soft white haze
hung like a veil over the land, precursor of a fine
day; but this effectually prevented Loïs distinguishing
any distant object. A few of the great forest
trees had been left standing in the garden, and
their thick foliage cast deep shadows, whilst a hedge
of oleanders screened the house from the high road
leading down to the village. On the other side was
the dark forest, stretching out farther than the eye
could see.</p>

<p>Still Loïs strained both eyes and ears; some one was
there, she felt sure. To a certain extent she had been
trained by Roger and Charles, when, in the days of
her early girlhood, she had accompanied them on their
forest excursions; her hearing was therefore keen and
her sight penetrating, and she knew now that she was
being watched though she could distinguish no one.
She bent farther out of the casement window and
showed herself. Then from beneath the shrubs, which
grew low down on the ground, she saw the dim outline
of a human face. It was dark, and the black,
straight hair hung about it, whilst the eyes shone forth
like coals of fire. Loïs started, and raised her hand
in token that she was aware of the strange presence;
instantly the dark face disappeared, and Loïs closed the
casement.</p>

<p>“What can she want? Has she brought a message
from him? Her coming never bodes good!” Even
while uttering these words, she had been hastily
dressing herself; and throwing a dark shawl round
her head and taking her shoes in her hand, she
cautiously opened her door and crept down the stairs.
It was evidently not the first time she had thus
manœuvred. Passing out by the back door, she kept
close up against the house wall until she reached
the corner; there she waited. No one, unless accustomed
to Indian ways, would have heard or seen
anything moving in that garden, and yet before
many seconds had elapsed the figure of a woman
rose up beside her.</p>

<p>“Nadjii!” said Loïs.</p>

<p>The woman smiled, and, taking the hand Loïs held
out to her, stroked it gently, as if the softness and the
whiteness pleased her.</p>

<p>“Is it bad news, Nadjii?” asked Loïs.</p>

<p>She nodded. Loïs sighed.</p>

<p>“Come this way,” she said; and skirting round the
house, they came to a sort of shed, used for putting
away garden tools and general rubbish.</p>

<p>“We shall be quiet here for a time,” said Loïs;
“but it is getting late; you must be quick, Nadjii.
Charles is surely not ill?”</p>

<p>The Indian shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, <i>you</i> ill,” she said softly, in broken English;
and then she continued, speaking rapidly, “They
will come; they will kill and burn. Run, run far
away.”</p>

<p>Every particle of colour left Loïs’ face. “Do you
mean your people are coming down to murder us?
Where is Charles?” she said.</p>

<p>“Away with the white man on the great sea. Nadjii
follow her own people, to watch for you; he say ‘Go,’
and Nadjii went. My people angry because your white
brother kill them, and the great Onontio angry. He
escape always, over mountains, rivers; no Indian
catch him.”</p>

<p>“Are you speaking of Roger?” said Loïs.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Indian. “Just kill Indians
in wood; Onontio angry, revenge.”</p>

<p>“But Roger is not here; he is far away. If your
people attack the settlement, thinking to find him
they will be disappointed. When are they coming?
Does Charles know of it?”</p>

<p>“No, no. They not dare come, if he knew,” said
Nadjii. “I tell you, he with the other white nation.
My people revenge.”</p>

<p>“And when are they going to attack us?” said Loïs,
trying to speak calmly.</p>

<p>“To-night,” answered Nadjii.</p>

<p>“My God!” said Loïs, burying her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>“No hurt you,” said the Indian gently. “Nadjii
watch over you.”</p>

<p>“What do I care for myself!” exclaimed Loïs
passionately. “It is my poor mother, the children,
the whole settlement! Oh, how can Charles let
them!” and she wrung her hands.</p>

<p>“He not know,” said Nadjii. “Great chief sent
for him to help, he go. Indians promise no hurt
you, but Roger kill; Ominipeg angry, they kill
too.”</p>

<p>“And you say they will attack us to-night?” said
Loïs.</p>

<p>“Ugh,”<sup>[2]</sup> said Nadjii. “I walk all night to tell you,
brothers other end of forest.”</p>

<p class='fn'>[Footnote 2: Indian for <i>yes</i>.]</p>

<p>“But if they miss you they will guess you have
come to warn us, and be angry,” said Loïs.</p>

<p>Nadjii shook her head; then, looking at Loïs,
she said, “Run, run quickly. My brothers will not
come while the sun shines; they wait till
the <i>gushkewau</i>.”<sup>[3]</sup></p>

<p class='fn'>[Footnote 3: Indian for <i>darkness</i>.]</p>

<p>“I will get you some milk and bread,” said Loïs,
ever thoughtful of others even in her sore trouble.
“Where have you left the child?” she added, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Nadjii smiled and pointed to the forest.</p>

<p>“Are you not afraid to leave him so long?” said
Loïs.</p>

<p>“<i>Æava-yea</i>,” said Nadjii softly, meaning thereby
“lullaby, he is sleeping.”</p>

<p>Loïs left her and went back into the house, reappearing
with bread and fruit and a can of milk.
She gave them to the Indian, saying,&#8212;</p>

<p>“You are sure they will not come till night?”</p>

<p>“Kaween, gushkewau,”<sup>[4]</sup> answered Nadjii. “Watch!”
and once more she pointed to the forest.</p>

<p class='fn'>[Footnote 4: <i>No indeed, darkness.</i>]</p>

<p>“You will be there?” asked Loïs.</p>

<p>“Ugh,” said the Indian.</p>

<p>“Are they many?” asked Loïs.</p>

<p>Nadjii stooped, picked up a handful of loose gravel,
and let it run slowly through her fingers. If it were
possible, Loïs’ face grew a shade paler.</p>

<p>“Go now,” she said; “the men on the farm are
beginning to stir; they must not see you. You are
faithful at least, and I thank you;” and stooping, she
kissed the Indian woman.</p>

<p>A flood of light came into the dark face, the
glow of a great love surging up in this savage
nature.</p>

<p>“The Great Spirit tell Nadjii die for you
and him!” she said, in a low voice; and before
Loïs could answer she had wrapped the otter skin
she wore round her, and darted away, disappearing
behind the trees and bushes with an incredible swiftness.</p>

<p>For one second Loïs stood still; then she roused
herself. “There is no time to lose. Shall I rouse
Marcus or Father Nat?” She came forth out of the
shed, and, as she did so, found herself face to face
with Marcus.</p>

<p>“Loïs, has anything happened?” he asked, looking
anxiously at her pale face.</p>

<p>“Nadjii has been here,” she answered. “The
Indians are going to attack us to-night.”</p>

<p>The fear was so constantly present with them all,
that the statement did not elicit even an exclamation
of surprise from Marcus; he only said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“I knew it must come sooner or later. I only wish
you women had accepted William Parkmann’s offer,
and were safe at Boston.”</p>

<p>“Neither mother nor I would have gone. You
know it, Marcus. More than ever are we bound to
stay by our people.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must go now; it won’t do for you to be
caught by the redskins. We’ve kept the cattle pretty
close. The best of the herds can be got in easily, and
then we must defend the old place as best we can; but
the first thing to be done is to get the women and
children out of the place. I’ll go and call Father
Nat.”</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the settlement were beginning
to show signs of life. Cocks crowing, dogs barking,
and the soft lowing of the cattle came gently
up from the valley above which the two homesteads
stood.</p>

<p>Without further speech the brother and sister parted,
Marcus crossing over to Father Nat, whom he met on
the threshold of his house.</p>

<p>“Well, lad, what’s brought you over so early?”
asked Nathaniel, taking his pipe from his mouth.
“We’re going to have a fine day. This sort of
weather is good for the land; we shall have a splendid
autumn.”</p>

<p>“I doubt if there’ll be much left to rejoice over by
this time to-morrow,” answered Marcus. “They’re
coming at last, Father Nat!”</p>

<p>“Who? The Indians?” exclaimed Nathaniel.</p>

<p>“Who else should I mean?” said Marcus. “Loïs
has seen Nadjii, Charles’ squaw, and she says they will
be down upon the settlement to-night.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence; then Nat said, “We
must lose no time; the waggons must be got out, and
the women and children sent off. They’ll be safe before
nightfall at Zanisville. Quick! send one of the men
to John Cleveland, and do you go down to the village,
and give the alarm; but above all things, there must
be no noise&#8212;the red men have their spies about, you
may be sure. The women must be got out of the
village quietly, through the valley on the other side,”
and he turned away.</p>

<p>Loïs had already spoken to her mother, and Father
Nat found Martha standing in the kitchen with the
two younger girls, Marie and Susan, clinging to
her.</p>

<p>“The waggons will be ready in half an hour,” he
said, “but you must go off on foot to avoid observation.
They will meet you on the other side of the valley
and take you to Zanisville, where you will be in safety.
Quick! make up your bundles and go. The Indians
are coming through the woods; happily, they be still
a good way off.”</p>

<p>“And you?” said Martha.</p>

<p>“Forewarned is forearmed,” answered Nathaniel.
“We shall not be attacked in the daytime; we are well
prepared. I hope we may teach these savages a lesson.
It would have been different if they had surprised us.
You need not go farther than Zanisville. We shall be
sending for you as soon as it is safe to do so.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was decided we were to remain,” said
Loïs.</p>

<p>“As long as it was safe to keep you,” said Nathaniel.
“Now the care and thought for you would be a
hindrance to us men. I mean to give these savages a
peppering which they shall remember, and you’re best
out of the way. We’ve settled it long ago. We’re
not taken unawares. The women and children will be
escorted by some thirty of our men over the hills; the
waggons will go round to meet you, and take you the
rest of the way: there’ll be no danger then; they’ll be
too busy with us. Don’t make any trouble; it’s got to
be as I say, Loïs.”</p>

<p>In view of an attack of the Indians, the elders had
arranged that a certain number of men should be told
off to protect the women and screen their retreat.
They had now the advantage of not being surprised,
and having time before them. Some of the women
were very unwilling to go, not believing the rumour&#8212;there
had been so many false alarms&#8212;but the men
insisted, and soon little groups were seen crossing the
valley and directing their steps through the mountain
gorges towards the spot where the waggons were to be
in waiting. So numerous were the outlets to the
valley, the roads were so zigzag, and the country was
so thickly wooded, that it was easy for the fugitives to
pass out unperceived; besides, the Indians were still
at a great distance, separated from the settlement by
a dense forest.</p>

<p>By noon the women and children were far on their
way; some had joined company, and on the whole they
were not as depressed as they might have been. In
two or three days they hoped to be recalled. The settlement
they were going to was comparatively at a short
distance, though better protected than the Marshes,
which lay quite on the borderland.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Boscowen and the men generally were in
good spirits; they had plenty of ammunition and were
prepared. The great danger of these night attacks
was in being surprised, and, thanks to Nadjii, this had
been avoided. Very quietly and without any display
they took their precautions. To all outward appearance
the usual daily life went on: the men drove the
cattle into the meadows, they worked in the fields,
some even fished in the river, and towards evening
they returned to the village, and apparently rested from
their labours, standing smoking and talking outside
their houses, and a few gathered in groups on the
square in front of the church; but a close observer
might have noticed that there was a strained look on
most of the men’s faces, as if they were listening for
some distant sound, and their eyes seemed to turn
instinctively towards the dark forest. In the kitchen
of Omega Marsh sat Father Nat, Marcus, the minister,
and half a dozen of the principal men of the settlement.
At Alpha Marsh lights were lit when night fell, and
for some time figures moved to and fro in the rooms,
so that its uninhabited condition should not be perceptible
from outside.</p>

<p>The clock had struck nine, when suddenly the
kitchen door opened, and some one entered. There
was no mistaking who it was. Father Nat and Marcus
both rose.</p>

<p>“Loïs!” they exclaimed together, in a tone of
reproach.</p>

<p>She went straight up to the elder man, and, laying
her hands on his shoulder, said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Dear Father Nat, my place is surely beside you and
Marcus. I am the eldest of my race. That my mother
should seek safety in flight for the sake of Marie and
Susie was right. I knew she would not go without
me, so I went; but when we got into the waggons and
she was safely off, I slipped out and came home. She
will probably not miss me for some hours, so she will be
spared all anxiety.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry you have done this thing, Loïs,” said
Father Nat anxiously.</p>

<p>“I am not,” said Loïs; “and now give me some
supper. I have had nothing since morning, and it has
been a long tramp.”</p>

<p>“It has indeed,” said the men present, looking at
her with affectionate pride. They had all known her
from her birth, and loved her almost as well as their
own children, and somehow they were glad to have her
back amongst them.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” asked Loïs.</p>

<p>“Yes, we are quite ready,” answered Father Nat.
Loïs ate the supper they hastened to place before
her, and then told them something of the day’s
journey.</p>

<p>“We saw no one on the road,” she said; “it seems
difficult to imagine such danger is threatening us.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I have heard sounds in the forest
which tell me plainly the Indians are not far off,”
said Nathaniel.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Loïs, rising, “I will lie down and sleep
for an hour; there is yet time.”</p>

<p>“Do,” said Father Nat, and Loïs went to her own
room and knelt beside her white bed and prayed, as
she had done all the years of her life, from childhood
to womanhood. Then, throwing herself on her bed, she
slept.</p>

</h2>


<p>The lights were extinguished; the inhabitants of
the Marshes were apparently sunk in slumber. It
was near upon midnight, but the moon was shining
so brightly that it seemed almost as if it were daylight.</p>

<p>Loïs had risen, and, standing in the darkness at a
window of an upper room at Omega Marsh, looking
down into the valley, was almost tempted to think
she must have been mistaken, that her interview with
Nadjii was an evil dream, the scene was so peacefully
lovely. The church spire rose in the midst of the surrounding
houses. She knew every one of them; their
inhabitants had been familiar to her since her childhood,
from the old grandfather to the toddling child
she had helped to carry on the road that morning.
By the light of the moon and stars she saw the outline
of the hills, and farther on the mountain ridges;
whilst the river gleamed here and there as it wound
through the meadows. But what riveted her gaze
was that dark, impenetrable forest. What did it conceal?
She knew full well that all around the garden
men belonging to the village lay on the ground
watching, even as she was watching. Would to God it
might be in vain! but Nadjii had spoken, and Loïs
had implicit confidence in the Indian woman.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without warning, a loud shout arose. Then
Loïs knew the enemy was at hand, and in the space of a
few seconds the settlement was surrounded. The Indians
poured down into the valley like a flock of locusts. Nat
had issued the order that no man was to stir until the
savages should have passed the boundaries, and then
to fire on them simultaneously. Up towards the
Marshes they swarmed, never doubting that the inhabitants
were sleeping; but they were soon undeceived&#8212;a
murderous fire came pouring down upon them.
Shrieks, howls of pain and anger, filled the air, and the
dark figures, with their waving headgears, leapt the
barriers, striking out to the right and left with their
murderous hatchets.</p>

<p>To Loïs, as she shrank back, it was as if all the devils
of hell had been suddenly let loose. Steadily the
fire continued; but so numerous were the assailants,
that even as they fell others poured in over them,
filling up the gaps. The settlement was surrounded on
all sides. The besieged were not long in perceiving this,
for the triumphant yells of the red men were heard on
every side.</p>

<p>“They are too many for us, Marcus,” said Father
Nat; “they are murdering our people wholesale down
yonder. Good Heavens! they are setting fire to the
barns; they’ll burn the village down!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid they will,” said Marcus. Even whilst
speaking they had not ceased firing. With a score of
other men they were crouching behind the trees in the
garden, just in front of Omega Marsh. Other groups
were scattered here and there, protecting the homestead.
The dead and wounded lay around, but the
assailants still came on, the circle narrowing as they
pressed forward.</p>

<p>“Where is Loïs?” asked Father Nat.</p>

<p>“Here,” she answered; and raising her gun, she
fired over his shoulder at an Indian, who had leapt
to within a yard of them.</p>

<p>“We must back into the house and bar the doors,”
she said; “it is our only chance.”</p>

<p>“I think she’s right,” said the minister, and slowly
they began to move backwards. A yell of delight from
the savages greeted this retrograde movement, and one
leapt forward, and, raising his tomahawk, would have
brought it down on Father Nat’s head, if a thrust from
a knife had not made the uplifted arm drop helpless,
and with a shriek of agony the man sprang back. At
the same moment Loïs felt herself lifted from the ground
and carried into the house. With a sudden rush the
others followed her. To bolt and bar the doors and
windows of the ground floor was the work of a few
seconds. Some of the men had ascended to the first
story, and were firing from the windows upon the
savages.</p>

<p>“We can only hold out a certain time,” said
John Cleveland; “and even that depends upon
their being kind enough not to set fire to the
place.”</p>

<p>It seemed very unlikely that the Indians would
refrain from doing so. The village was burning;
and by the light of the flames the terrible fight
which was going on below and around was clearly
visible.</p>

<p>It was evident they had some reason for not setting
fire to the homestead, probably the desire of taking
the inhabitants alive for the purpose of torturing
them “Father Nat” more especially, their anger being
directed against Roger. The house was strongly built,
the doors and windows secured by heavy iron bars, and
so far the savages had been kept at bay by the
incessant firing of the beleaguered. Suddenly they
appeared to retreat, making a rush round to the back
of the house. At the same moment Nadjii stood by
the side of Loïs.</p>

<p>“See!” she whispered. “Roger;” and even as
she spoke, running swiftly up the hill with shouts of
“Hurrah, hurrah!” they saw the well-known red shirts
of the Rangers.</p>

<p>“Saved,” said Father Nat, turning round quickly.
“My brave lad!” He had hardly uttered the words
when he was felled to the earth, and the room was
filled with savages, yelling, hewing to the right hand
and to the left. The settlers were grouped together
in a corner of the room, keeping the savages at bay
with their guns and rifles.</p>

<p>The last thing Loïs saw was Nadjii, who, thrusting
her behind her, with blood flowing down her own
half-naked body, held aloft a glittering steel knife
stained with gore.</p>

<p>The sun rose upon a scene of utter devastation.
The village of Marshwood lay in ruins; upwards of one
hundred men had been killed, or, worse still, were
missing.</p>

<p>Almost the only house which stood uninjured was
Alpha Marsh; evidently the Indians had their reasons
for respecting it. Their own loss was immense. The
sudden appearance of the Rangers had been totally
unexpected. When the savages had forced an entrance
at the back and had swarmed into the house,
Roger and his men took them in the rear and cut
them to pieces, at the same time as they were being
fired on by the besieged; retreat was therefore impossible,
and they perished to a man. A few threw themselves
out of the windows in the hope of escaping,
but were either killed in the fall or bayoneted by
their opponents stationed below; the same thing went
on throughout the village. In less than an hour
after the Rangers appeared, the Indians were swept
away, leaving their dead and wounded to the mercy
of the conquerors.</p>

<p>Of the group of men who had defended Omega
Marsh only a few escaped unwounded. When the fight
was at an end, and Roger forced his way over the dead
into the room where the besieged had taken refuge,
an awful sight met his eyes. Father Nat lay apparently
killed, Loïs was close beside him senseless, and
almost covering them with her naked body, gashed
with wounds, lay Nadjii.</p>

<p>The scene was one of indescribable horror. For
a second Roger’s spirit failed him. The survivors,
faint and exhausted, hardly believing they were saved,
still stood with their weapons in their hands. Marcus,
badly wounded himself, was striving to get at Loïs,
but the Indian woman’s body had to be moved first,
and he had no strength left. Stern and agonised was
Roger’s face, as John Cleveland, clasping his hand,
said, with a sob in his voice,&#8212;</p>

<p>“He knew you had come to the rescue. A minute
sooner and you would have saved him.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure he is dead?” said Roger, in a hoarse
voice, as he helped Marcus to move Nadjii and Loïs;
and then he raised his father in his arms. Apparently
dead he certainly was; but the face was so swollen and
disfigured by a ghastly wound on the forehead that it
was impossible to say positively.</p>

<p>“He and the women had better be carried over to
Alpha Marsh,” he said; “the flames are spreading
below. I must go and help my men.”</p>

<p>At that moment Loïs opened her eyes, and consciousness
came back to her immediately. She sat up and
looked around.</p>

<p>“Oh, Roger!” she exclaimed; and for the first
time for years he did not turn away from her, but
asked,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Loïs?”</p>

<p>She tried to rise. John Cleveland gave her his hand.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, “I think not; it is their
blood,” and she shivered, pointing to her blood-stained
garments.</p>

<p>“Alpha Marsh is uninjured; we are going to carry
Father Nat there.”</p>

<p>“And she?” said Loïs, looking down at Nadjii.</p>

<p>“If you wish it,” answered Roger, turning away.</p>

<p>And so Nathaniel was laid in the best chamber of
Alpha Marsh, and Nadjii in Loïs’ own bedroom.</p>

<p>Nokomis, the Huron woman who had served
Nathaniel ever since he rescued her from another
tribe of Indians, who had slain her son and her
husband, came out of hiding, and with a few other
women, some old, some sick, who had refused to leave
the settlement, set to work to tend the wounded.</p>

<p>“He no dead, she no dead,” said Nokomis, after
washing the blood from Father Nat’s head and body,
and, with Loïs’ help, performing the same office for
Nadjii. “But,” she added, shaking her head, “they
both die; no meda<sup>[5]</sup> save her.”</p>

<p class='fn'>[Footnote 5: Medicine-man.]</p>

<p>“But you are as good as a meda,” said Lois. “You
know of herbs and salves, Nokomis; you must try what
you can do.”</p>

<p>“For my Nosa<sup>[6]</sup> perhaps,” she said, as she bound
up the ghastly wound which had lain Father Nat’s
head open; “but for the Nadjii, she dead;” and yet
as Loïs bent over the dark face, and held a feather
to her lips, she knew that Nadjii still lived.</p>

<p class='fn'>[Footnote 6: Master.]</p>

<p>“Oh, Nokomis,” she said, tears running down her
face, “she tried to save us all; if I am living it is
because she stood between me and death. She has
a brave heart.”</p>

<p>“She is a chief’s daughter,” answered Nokomis, with
certain dignity; “but she must die; her hour is come.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought struck Loïs; her pale face
flushed.</p>

<p>The child&#8212;where had Nadjii left the child?</p>

</h2>


<p>“How did you know they were coming against us?”
said Minister Cleveland. “We heard a fortnight
ago that you were up on the shores of Lake Champlain.”</p>

<p>“I was not far from there,” answered Roger. “We
have had a hard time of it lately, harassed on all sides
by the French, the Canadians, and Indians. I had
drawn my men off, to give them a few days’ rest; for in
our last skirmish we had lost several men, and others
had been wounded. I was lying half-asleep and half-awake
at the foot of a tree one night, when I became
conscious of some one creeping round from behind. In
a second I was on foot, and at the same moment an
Indian youth rose up before me. I seized him, and
knew at once he was an Iroquois. I had seen him
before; he was Nadjii’s half-brother.</p>

<p>“‘What are you doing here?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘Nadjii tell me come,’ he answered, in his native dialect. ‘Find the
“Brave Heart,”’ she said, ‘and tell him to be near the old Nosa before the
moon is at its full.’</p>

<p>“‘There’s mischief brewing against the Marshes
then?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘I do not know; Nadjii say come,’ he answered.</p>

<p>“‘Where is she? and where is the white chief, her
husband?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘Nadjii watch the white maiden. The white chief
with the white men up at the City on the Rock.’</p>

<p>“Then I knew that Charles was with General Montcalm,
and that a tribe, probably the one I had escaped
from, was about to attack the Marshes out of revenge.</p>

<p>“‘It is well,’ I answered. ‘You stay with me. If
you speak truly, good; if you deceive us&#8212;&#8212;’ and I
made a well-known sign of punishment. He only
smiled, and sat down on the ground in token of
consent.</p>

<p>“An hour later we were on our way; but it is a long
journey, and we had to keep clear of the Indians. The
nearer we got to Marshwood, the more we became
aware of their presence. We had to take a circuitous
path, which delayed us and made us late.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the minister; “but for that poor
creature dying upstairs, we should all of us have been
murdered in cold blood.”</p>

<p>This conversation had taken place in Alpha kitchen,
where, late at night, the two men found themselves
alone for the first time: the call upon both of them
from within and without had been incessant. They
had not only to attend to the living, but had to arrange
for the removal of the dead bodies of the killed&#8212;no
light task.</p>

<p>Father Nat had shown unmistakable signs of life, but
was still insensible. A messenger had been despatched
to the nearest town for a doctor, and was expected to
return next day; in the meanwhile Nokomis had brewed
herbs, and, with Loïs, done what she could for the
sufferers. Now Loïs was watching beside Nadjii. It
was midnight, and still they had no news of the child.
Where had the mother hidden it when she came to
the rescue? With Marcus’ help Loïs had searched
the house and outhouses, and assured herself it
was not there. It lay probably in the forest in the
trunk of some tree.</p>

<p>Evidently having become possessed of the secret of
the tribe, Nadjii had travelled alone with her child
through the forest, crossing rivers and rapids as only
an Indian woman could, to reach the Marshes in time
and warn the inmates. On the night of the attack she
must have lain the child to sleep in some hidden place;
but where? It would surely die if its mother could
not tell.</p>

<p>Nadjii was wounded unto death, and Loïs knew it;
a few hours at most and she would cease to live, carrying
her secret away with her, and her child’s hope of
life! Loïs, as she knelt beside Nadjii, seemed to hear
the wailing of the infant, the helpless cry for mother’s
milk and mother’s kisses. “O Father, have mercy on
the innocent babe,” she prayed; “let it not die this
terrible death! My poor Nadjii has been faithful and
true, and has laid down her life for her husband’s
people, moved by the great love she bears him.”</p>

<p>Truly love, the great purifier, entering this poor
heathen’s heart, had taught her many things, lightening
her darkness! To her, though she knew it not,
had been revealed the primary laws of love, obedience,
and self-sacrifice! Her husband had bidden her watch
over Loïs and his mother, and report to him if harm
threatened them; and she had done what she could&#8212;she
had laid down her life for them. All these
thoughts crowded through Loïs’ mind as she knelt
and prayed. She had all the early Puritan’s faith in
prayer. No conflicting doubts troubled her. God
would surely hear her!</p>

<p>“Spare the child, O God!” she repeated again and
yet again, her clasped hands stretched out over the
body of the dying mother. Her eyes were closed, her
pale face raised, she was as one wrestling with God.
Suddenly a word fell on her ear, “<i>Nenemoosha</i>.”<sup>[7]</sup>
She turned quickly and looked at the Indian woman.
Her eyes were open, and from out the swollen lips
came in a voice almost inaudible the same word
repeated, “Nenemoosha.” Tears sprang to Loïs’ eyes.
She understood the meaning; and, bending over
Nadjii, said, “Tell me where he is and I will fetch
him.” The answer came, but in quick Indian words;
and though Loïs understood a few, she could not follow
her.</p>

<p class='fn'>[Footnote 7: Sweetheart.]</p>

<p>“Wait! I will fetch some one,” she said; but before
leaving Nadjii she gave her a cordial and damped the
cloth that was bound round her head, whispering,
“Never fear, Nadjii; we will find Nenemoosha.” Then
she left her, smiling back at her as she went, though her
heart was very sore. She had thought to fetch Nokomis,
but the old Indian had been called away from Father
Nat’s bedside to tend another wounded man, and had
left an ancient village crone in charge. Hastily Loïs ran
into the kitchen, where John Cleveland the minister
and Roger were together.</p>

<p>“Roger,” said Loïs, going up to him, “Nadjii, the
squaw, has spoken, but I cannot understand her; you
must come. She left her and his child somewhere in
the forest when she came to our rescue. You must
go for it. Come!”</p>

<p>Roger started back from her, anger flashing from
his eyes.</p>

<p>“A child of such a brood! Better let it die, Loïs.
Would you nurture a viper in your bosom?” he said.</p>

<p>“It is my brother’s child, and its mother is dying
for me!” said Loïs passionately, and she burst into
tears.</p>

<p>A great struggle was visible in the hunter’s face. He
hated this Indian woman, who, to his mind, had helped
to decoy his friend. Why should he save her child?</p>

<p>“She is dying; fetch the child for her, Roger, and
then I will depart with it, and you shall see our faces
no more!” and Loïs threw herself on her knees before
him. “By our old love,” she murmured. He turned
away and strode up to the room where he knew they
had laid Nadjii. Loïs and the minister followed.</p>

<p>All the soul of the dying woman was reflected in
her eyes. When she saw Roger she strove to lift
herself, but Loïs sprang to her side and laid her hand
upon her, saying,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Tell him where to find Nenemoosha. He will go
for him,” she said.</p>

<p>Nadjii lay motionless, wounded from head to foot,
tortured with awakening agony.</p>

<p>Loïs moistened her lips, and smiled down on her
dark sister as an angel might.</p>

<p>Then Nadjii spoke, quickly, gaspingly, looking at
Roger. When she ceased, he bowed his head and left
the room.</p>

<p>“Shall you be able to find it?” asked the minister.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Roger. “She has hidden it in
the trunk of a tree about a mile distant, and she has
marked the trees leading to the one where the child
lies by an arrow cut in the bark; if it be still there I
shall find it;” and he strode out of the house.</p>

<p>In less than an hour he came back, but his arms
were empty.</p>

<p>“They have stolen it,” he said to Loïs, who met him.
“She had made a bed of leaves for it, and I saw where
it had been; but I also saw the track of a man’s foot
round the tree, and the hands of a man had touched
the child’s resting-place. It is gone.”</p>

<p>“What shall I say to her?” said Loïs, wringing her
hands and weeping.</p>

<p>“You will not need to say anything,” answered the
minister; “she is even now passing away. Come.”</p>

<p>They re-entered the room, and truly they knew that
death was there before them. The veil was slowly being
drawn across things earthly for the poor Indian woman;
her eyes were already dim, her senses failing. The
minister knelt down and prayed that the departing soul
might awaken in another world to new knowledge and
new light; and even as he prayed the answer came. A
flash of light shot from Nadjii’s eyes, and a cry went up
from her lips, “Jesus! Nenemoosha!” and she looked
straight before her, as if she saw a vision; and so
looking, the light died out of her face, and Nadjii
slept.</p>

<h2 id='chXXI' title='XXI—AT THE HELM'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.1em'>AT THE HELM</span>
</h2>


<p>After his repulse from Ticonderoga, General Abercromby
made no marked effort to retrieve his
position; his troops were disheartened, and fearing
another attack by the French, he hastened to retire
down Lake St. George, and to protect himself in an
intrenched camp. In October, after the taking of
Louisburg, General Amherst joined him; but it was
then too late in the year to renew active service.
Montcalm with his army withdrew for the winter to
Montreal, and the English returned to Albany.</p>

<p>The English were, however, slowly gaining ground.
Fort Duquesne, after immense labour and many hardships,
was wrested by Brigadier-General Forbes from
the French, and re-baptised, in honour of the great
statesman, Pittsburg. Fort Frontenac was also captured,
and this was more especially important as it
gave the English a footing on Lake Ontario. And so
the year 1758 came to a close, and the nations knew,
both at home and abroad, that the great contest was
likely to be fought out during the ensuing year; but
whilst the land lay under its white covering of snow,
with ice-bound rivers, there was peace, or rather a
cessation of hostilities, and the leaders at home and
abroad looked around to see who were the men most
fitted to place at the helm.</p>

<p>Pitt had for some time past had his eye on a man
who had already distinguished himself at the siege of
Louisburg, James Wolfe. After the taking of that
fortress he had desired to push on at once to Quebec;
but he was overruled by the other generals, and a far
more disagreeable task was allotted to him. It was
considered necessary to destroy all the French settlements
on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and he was deputed
to carry out the order.</p>

<p>It is difficult for us now to realise the extent of
misery this decision entailed; certainly it was more especially
repugnant to a sensitive, humane nature such as
Wolfe’s. It meant laying waste hundreds of pleasant
homesteads, driving their inhabitants forth shelterless!
The wailing of women and children, the low,
bitter curses of the men&#8212;all this had to be borne
with apparent stoicism. Always delicate, already suffering
from the disease to which he was to succumb,
Wolfe’s health entirely broke down under the severe
mental and moral strain, and it was found necessary to
grant him a prolonged leave of absence. He immediately
set sail for England, hoping in the quiet of his
home and his much-loved mother’s society to recruit
his shattered health. His was a peculiar nature, a
strange mixture of tenderness and passion; loving
and sensitive beyond measure, yet at times strangely
fierce and stern. His mother was wont to say he was
a living barometer, his spirits rising and falling with
every change of weather.</p>

<p>With such a character it was hardly possible for him
to have been what we generally term a happy man;
there were too many contradictions in his nature.
When still quite young he either was, or imagined
himself to be, in love; the result was a bitter disappointment,
and for some time afterwards he plunged
into a life of dissipation. At the early age of twenty-three
he was already lieutenant-colonel (he had entered
the army at fourteen), and was sent in garrison
to Inverness. Here he remained five years, a great
favourite with both his men and fellow-officers, but so
entirely isolated from society that, as he expressed it
himself, “He feared lest he should become a ruffian.”
Once more he went to the other extreme, like a pendulum,
and for six months took up his residence in
Paris, devoting himself to the study of the French
language and to the acquirement of every social accomplishment.</p>

<p>He was, we are told by those who knew him most
intimately, possessed of only moderate abilities; but his
diligence and perseverance were so remarkable that he
accomplished anything he set his heart upon. Effeminacy
was hateful to him; he was essentially a high-principled
man, with a strong sense of duty, ever faithful
to his ideal of what a true soldier ought to be&#8212;“always
ready to meet the fate we cannot shun, and die gracefully
when my hour comes,” he said on one occasion, and
truly he carried this axiom out through life unto
death!</p>

<p>In personal appearance he might almost have been
considered an ugly man. He had a retreating forehead
and chin; his nose was upturned, and formed with
other features the point of an obtuse triangle. His
mouth was by no means shaped to express resolution.
The redeeming point in his face was his eyes; they were
clear, bright, and piercing, full of spirit. His hair was
red, and, according to the custom of the time, tied in
a queue, and he always wore a black three-cornered
hat. His physique denoted less than ordinary strength.
He is represented with narrow shoulders, slender body,
long thin limbs cased in scarlet frock-coat with broad
cuffs and ample skirts, which reached down to his
knees. Such was the outward seeming and character
of the man who played so conspicuous a part in a war
which ultimately gave to England one of her richest
and most loyal colonies.</p>

<p>It was with a sense of relief that after the capture of
Louisburg Wolfe set sail for England. His experiences
of the last few months had impressed him so painfully
that he hoped never to return to Canada. He had strong
domestic tastes, his affection for his mother was the
dominant passion of his life, and he had been but a few
weeks in England when he proposed to and was accepted
by a Miss Lowther; and so life seemed to be dawning
for him in roseate hues. He was only thirty-three
years of age, and was beloved both at home and abroad;
his delicate health was the only shadow on his horizon,
but it was hoped that perfect rest and good nursing
would restore that. Therefore, throughout that winter
Wolfe remained at home, perfectly happy, ignoring
the fact that William Pitt’s eagle eye had already
marked him out, and that his name was destined to be
handed down to posterity among those men who have
deserved well of their country.</p>

<p>But, whilst physically Wolfe was being thus
strengthened for the fray, his great opponent was
losing heart. Throughout that winter Montcalm
recognised more than ever the many discordant
elements by which he was surrounded.</p>

<p>The Governor’s jealousy had increased; he took every
opportunity in his power for disparaging Montcalm,
even going the length of demanding from the Court
at Versailles that he should be recalled. But indifferent
as the French king and his ministers were to the real
interests of Canada, they were still sufficiently clear-sighted
to know that General Montcalm was the right
man in the right place, and to a certain extent to
appreciate the services he had rendered the state.
They therefore raised his rank to that of lieutenant-general,
as also his officers Bourlamaque and Levis,
who were made colonel and major-general.</p>

<p>But in his own heart Montcalm knew that when
the Forts of Niagara, Crown Point, and Duquesne fell
into the hands of the English, the end could not be
far off. Little by little he was becoming isolated and
cut off on the St. Lawrence, the British holding the
command of the seas. He was possessed, however,
of great military genius, and displayed to the last
extraordinary skill in defending the French possessions.</p>

<p>During the winter the social life at Montreal was
wholly in contradiction to the General’s feelings, so that
he withdrew himself entirely from society, remaining in
his own quarters, occupied with combining plans for the
spring campaign, which he foresaw would decide the
fate of Canada. This conduct was of itself a cause of
complaint against him, being a reproach to Bigot and
his associates, in whose palace at Quebec every night
high revelry reigned. Supper parties, dances, and
masquerades were of nightly occurrence; and worse
still, gambling was carried to such a pitch that the
results had in many cases to be hushed up.</p>

<p>Mercèdes lived in her rooms at the Intendance,
ignorant of what was going on below. Like her father,
retiring more and more from public life, seldom seen
except on her way to church or on her visits to the poor,
without knowing it she was a sort of hostage for her
father. Probably she would not have been allowed to
remain so entirely in the background but for Madame
Péan’s open protection. That lady reigned supreme in
the gay world at Quebec, and she would not suffer
her protégée to be annoyed. “She is in my charge;
she shall not be molested,” she was wont to say when
it was hinted by the government officials that it
would strengthen their arguments against Montcalm
if his daughter could be persuaded to join in their
revelries.</p>

<p>“It is quite useless,” Madame Péan declared; “she
would not understand our ways. You would scare her
quite away.”</p>

<p>But one night the revelry had attained even wilder
proportions than usual. A sumptuous supper succeeded
a masquerade ball. Towards morning the guests dispersed,
and only about twenty intimates remained.
Some one suddenly said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“What a joke it would be if we were to surprise
Monsieur de Vaudreuil and General Montcalm at
Montreal!”</p>

<p>There was a general laugh.</p>

<p>“Why not do so?” said Intendant Bigot. “We
could be there in three days’ sleighing. If it would
afford the ladies any pleasure, they have but to command.
I am their humble servant.”</p>

<p>“It would cost a fortune,” said Madame Péan.</p>

<p>“You are growing economical, my dear,” retorted
Madame Marin; “there is the king’s exchequer! I vote
we do it, and we will take Mademoiselle Mercèdes with
us to see her father. This gentle attention will soften
the old bear, and he will not have the heart to reproach
us. What do you say to my plan, Monsieur
Bigot?”</p>

<p>“Only what I said before, that if you ladies wish
it we will start at midday, reach Pointe-aux-Trembles
in time for supper, sleep there, and go on the next
day to St. Anne. Our next halt might be at the
Isle des Castors, where Rigaud would entertain us, and
finally Montreal. If you will decide at once, I will
despatch couriers to have everything in readiness.
What are <i>your</i> wishes, Madame?” he added, addressing
himself to Madame Péan, whose beauty and accomplishments
always ensured her the first place in every
project for the general amusement.</p>

<p>“I am willing,” she said carelessly.</p>

<p>“And you will persuade Mademoiselle Mercèdes
to join us?” insisted Madame Marin.</p>

<p>“If she knows she is likely to see her father she
will not refuse,” answered Madame Péan. “She will
go in my sleigh.”</p>

<p>“I wish you joy!” said one of her lady friends.
“What you see in that little dull thing, to have her
always about with you, is more than I can imagine.
Why, I saw you out sleighing with her and that Indian
hunter, Charles Langlade, last week, near the village
of Beauport. Are you trying to make a match of
it?”</p>

<p>“I wish I could,” answered Madame Péan; “but
you know as well as I do he has his Indian squaw.
Now, good-night, or rather good-morning; I am off
to get a few hours’ sleep.”</p>

<p>There was a general leave-taking, and it was agreed
they should all meet at midday on the morrow; and
so the ladies retired, but the gentlemen remained in
consultation as to ways and means.</p>

<p>“I intend it to be a grand affair,” said Bigot
ostentatiously. “We will spare no expense, eh, Marin?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not! Why should we? It is necessary
for the good of the country. You require to see Vaudreuil; De Martet and Varin have to look after the
army and navy supplies. We are going on the king’s
service, therefore the king must pay. Long live the
King!”</p>

<p>“Long live our Gracious Master the King!” they
all shouted in high spirits, and forthwith began
arranging for the projected excursion. The light of
the dim November morning was slowly creeping into
the palace when they separated to snatch a brief repose.</p>

</h2>


<p>“Go to Montreal and see my dear father? You do
not really mean it!” exclaimed Mercèdes, clapping
her hands in sheer childish delight.</p>

<p>“Indeed I do. We are starting in a few hours,” said
Madame Pèan, smiling. “Can you be ready?”</p>

<p>“Ready? I should think so indeed! I have nothing
to do,” said Mercèdes. “I suppose Marthe will stay
here. You will not mind being alone for a few days,
shall you?” she said, turning to her nurse.</p>

<p>“No, Mademoiselle, assuredly not. Go and amuse
yourself; your life is dull enough, and yet the
General&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Marthe!” interrupted Mercèdes reproachfully.
“Do you think I would care to go if it were
not to see my father, and perhaps have news of the
dear ones at Candiac? It is so long since I heard
from them.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” said Madame Péan. “I will
take good care of her, Marthe; and only think how
delighted the General will be to see his daughter.”</p>

<p>“I hope the General will be satisfied,” answered
Marthe doubtfully; “but he particularly desired I
should never leave Mademoiselle, and you know he
does not approve&#8212;&#8212;”</p>

<p>“That is enough, Marthe; I will take all responsibility
on myself; and, after all, Mademoiselle is in my
charge, and you know, I think, by this time, that I love
her dearly.” Then turning to Mercèdes, Madame Péan
continued, “You will be ready by twelve o’clock, dearest.
Mind you have plenty of furs and wraps of all sorts. It
is freezing hard; it is grand weather. Fancy sleighing
from Quebec to Montreal! It will be something to say
one has accomplished such a feat! Now, good-bye;
come down to my rooms when you are ready. Adieu,
Marthe. You need not be anxious about your nursling.”
And she left them.</p>

<p>Two years and a half had elapsed since Mercèdes
first set foot in Canada, and from a mere girl she had
developed into a woman. She was small and slender,
and still looked very young; indeed, though she was
now eighteen years of age, she was but little altered.
She had more colour, and was healthier in appearance,
which, with her bright dark eyes and soft smile, made
her almost good-looking. She and Marthe had settled
down to their quiet way of living, and by degrees had
been nearly forgotten by the outside world. The
General had ceased to worry about her, and was only
too glad when he visited Quebec, which he did not
do sometimes for several months at a time, to find
Mercèdes, with her ready sympathy and warm affection.
It was the only real relaxation he knew of; and many a
happy hour was passed in those little rooms overlooking
the convent. By degrees they had come to
a sort of tacit agreement that she should not enter the
convent until the war was ended. If the truth must
be told, Mercèdes experienced a sense of relief when
this was decided; she had grown to love Canada, for
the defence of which her father was giving the best
years of his life, and all the genius with which nature
had endowed him.</p>

<p>She had made many excursions in the neighbourhood
of Quebec, sometimes in company with Madame Péan,
sometimes alone with Marthe, and was never tired of
admiring the lovely scenery. The village of Beauport,
with its whitewashed dwellings, situated on the curving
shore of the river St. Charles, and stretching down to
the rocky gorge of Montmorenci, charmed her. The
fields on either side were studded with huts and Indian
wigwams. In the short summer and early autumn
the varied colour of the trees lent great brilliancy to
the landscape. The hills, which had shrunk almost out
of sight on one hand, looking like a long purple line
against the horizon, drew suddenly so near the shore
that at one point they seemed to rise almost out of the
water.</p>

<p>In the winter the scene was changed, but she
loved it still; the joyous sleigh bells, making music
as the sleighing parties flew through the villages and
hamlets lying beneath their snowy shroud, filled the
girl’s heart with gladness, and she realised to the full
the joy of living. And so time had passed quickly with
her, and she had been happy, with the quiet, unreasoning
happiness of the young, to whom the past has brought
little sadness, and upon whom the future smiles with
all the enchanting fascination of unbounded hope.
And then Mercèdes was not given to anticipate
trouble. Her strong religious sentiments gave her a
calm faith which never deserted her, and next to God
she believed in her father. The struggle might be
long, might be difficult, but assuredly he would come
forth a conqueror.</p>

<p>It was with feelings of unmitigated delight that she
prepared for her journey; but her astonishment was
great when she became aware of the proportions the
party had assumed. When the hour for their departure
came, no less than twenty sleighs were drawn up along
the length of the street. Crowds gathered to see them
start; but amidst the general laughter and mirth some
bitter speeches were overheard, such as, “The Intendant,
M. Bigot, was going to Montreal to see the Governor
and the General. It was a strange necessity that he
must needs have such a goodly company of ladies and
gentlemen to escort him.”</p>

<p>But when M. Bigot appeared with Mercèdes and
Madame Péan, there was a respectful silence. It was
the great General’s daughter he was conducting; of
course it must be all right. Thus the effect he had
anticipated was attained; and he took his place beside
the ladies in high spirits, bowing and smiling on the
people, addressing one or two by name, and thus by
word and manner propitiating them; so that he drove off
with the good wishes of those who at first had seemed
hostile, and to the friendly cry of “Bon voyage.”</p>

<p>The three days’ journey resembled a royal progress.
Couriers had been sent on in advance, and at each
resting-place the most elaborate preparations had been
made for the reception of the company. Mercèdes
was bewildered. She was the object of the most
marked attention; she had never been so surrounded,
so courted in her life. When they reached Montreal,
almost the whole population turned out to see them;
but from amidst the crowd murmurs of discontent
were rife at such unnecessary display on the part of
the Government, when the people were oppressed by
taxes, and the most ordinary articles of daily consumption
were at famine prices. Anger, and even
threats, were not lacking. Mercèdes was startled by
the cold severity of her father’s manner when he
became aware of her presence.</p>

<p>“You here, Mercèdes!” he said, as she threw her
arms round his neck.</p>

<p>“Yes, father. Are you not glad to see me?” she
answered, tears filling her eyes.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, my child, but not under
present circumstances,” he answered. “You should
not have left Quebec without my permission. In the
present state of Canada it is a disgrace to the Government
to incur such unnecessary expenses, and it is not
well that my daughter should be mixed up with such
dissipation. I shall not allow you to join in the gaieties
which are probably about to take place. As soon as I
can find an escort to take you back to Quebec you will
return thither; but not to Madame Péan’s house. You
will enter the Ursulines, and commence your novitiate
at once. I have temporised too long. Whatever
happens, you will be safer there.”</p>

<p>He conducted her straight to the apartment he
occupied. His annoyance was very great. He perfectly
understood that Mercèdes had been used as a tool by
his enemies, to give the appearance of his sanction to
what was wanton extravagance and display.</p>

<p>That night there was a grand ball, followed by a
sumptuous supper, at the Government House, but
neither Montcalm nor his daughter was present. For
the first time he explained the difficulties of his position
to Mercèdes, and she responded, showing herself intelligent,
and capable of understanding the annoyances to
which he was daily subject.</p>

<p>“I am sorry I came, dear father,” she said; “but I
only thought of the pleasure of seeing you, and the
journey with Madame Péan seemed such a simple
thing, that I attached no importance to it. For myself,
I am such an insignificant little personage; I forgot I
was your daughter!”</p>

<p>He smiled. “We will say no more about it, my
child. Do not doubt for one moment that it is a great
delight to have you with me, even for a few days,
especially as indirectly I have had news from Candiac.
Your brother the Count is betrothed to an heiress, and
will be married shortly; and your eldest sister is already
Madame d’Espineuse. You know that has been an
attachment of long standing; it is a great pleasure to
me to think of her happiness.”</p>

<p>“I am indeed glad!” said Mercèdes. “Dear Louise!
This good account of the family ought to cheer you,
father. Soon, very soon perhaps, you will join them,”
and a sigh escaped her.</p>

<p>Her father heard it, and, putting his arm round her,
kissed her affectionately. “If I return to my dear
Candiac, Mercèdes, I shall certainly not leave you
behind. Had you taken the veil immediately upon
your arrival in Canada, the case would have been
different: you would have become accustomed to your
life; but now you would feel yourself forsaken&#8212;besides,
it is too late. The war must come to a close before
next autumn, and you will not then have completed
your novitiate: therefore your residence at the Ursulines
can only be temporary; but I think it decidedly
safer for you to take refuge there at once. What does
my daughter say?”</p>

<p>“That you are quite right; and, besides, you have
brought your children up to obey, and not reason,
father. As soon as I return to Quebec I will enter the
convent. I am no stranger there; the good sisters
know me; and from my window I have looked down
for months past into the convent gardens, feeling
always that my home was there.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you are content,” answered her father.
“I have blamed myself for leaving you so long in the
world, fearing it might have taken hold of you and
robbed you of your peace of mind.”</p>

<p>She coloured slightly. “I am satisfied,” she said,
“to do what you think best, father.”</p>

<p>At that moment there was a knock at the door,
and the General’s servant entered and handed his
master a slip of folded paper. It was from Charles
Langlade, requesting an interview with the General.</p>




</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 id='chXXIII' title='XXIII—A CONFESSION'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.1em'>A CONFESSION</span>
</h2>


<p>“Certainly, tell Monsieur Langlade I shall be
most happy to receive him,” said the General;
and turning to his daughter, he added, “You will be
glad to see your old friend. He has done me good
service: at Ticonderoga he conducted several scouting
parties; now he is in the neighbourhood of Montreal.
I always feel that I have some one I can depend upon
when he is near. I shall never understand how he
came to join the Indians. Love of freedom, I suppose.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished speaking when the door
opened and Charles Langlade entered. Mercèdes was
sitting in the shadow, so that he did not see her immediately,
but she noticed at once that a great change
had come over him. There was a look of pain&#8212;even
more than pain, of great sorrow&#8212;in his face. The
General was also quick to see that something was
wrong; and, holding out his hand to welcome him,
as if moved by some instinct, he asked,&#8212;</p>

<p>“What has happened?”</p>

<p>“Ah! you see it!” answered the young man, drawing
his brows together and compressing his lips. “My
mother told me I should repent of my self-will, and
now I am truly punished. God has humbled me. My
people are slain and the home of my fathers is in
ruins.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean the Indians have made a raid
on the Marsh settlement and destroyed it?” said the
General.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Charles sadly. “I am given to
understand that a tribe of the Iroquois attacked the
Marshes. I believe it is the same tribe which has
been following up my old friend Roger the Ranger,
and from which he twice escaped. They were fearfully
irritated against him, and of course in my position I
could not interfere to protect him; but the Marshes
they knew to be my home, and it was an understood
thing they were to respect them. I suppose they were,
as usual, carried away by their desire for vengeance.
The man who brought me the news says most of the
women and children escaped; but the men have perished
or been taken prisoners, which is worse, and the village
was in flames when he left. He has been stopped on
the road by illness, or I should have known this a month
ago. It appears that at the last moment some one, I
do not know who, warned those at the Marshes that an
attack was meditated, and so to a certain extent they were
prepared; as I said, the women and children were got
rid of, and the men defended themselves to the death.
Some must have escaped, but my informant was unable
to tell me who they were.” And having spoken, he
stood with his head bent and his eyes fixed on the
ground, with all the appearance of a man who has lost
heart.</p>

<p>“It is indeed a terrible misfortune,” said the General;
“but, who knows? perhaps you have heard an exaggerated
account. Come and sit down. We are just going
to supper; stay and have it with us. You have not
noticed my daughter; she came with Bigot and Co.
from Quebec to-day. You may imagine I am not
best pleased.”</p>

<p>On hearing of Mercèdes’ presence, Charles looked up,
and a light came into his eyes; and going up to her,
he said quietly,&#8212;</p>

<p>“This is unexpected; it does me good, if anything
can do me good.”</p>

<p>“I am so sorry for you,” said Mercèdes, holding out
her hand. “Won’t you sit down and tell us more
about it? Surely you will cease to live with the
Indians now, and return to your own people.”</p>

<p>“Alas! I cannot,” answered Charles; “I am bound
to them.” He hesitated. “I married Ominipeg’s
daughter. I have a squaw wife.”</p>

<p>If any one had observed her closely they would have
seen Mercèdes’ cheek pale for a second&#8212;only for a
second; it was her father who answered.</p>

<p>“It seems incredible,” he said; “how came you to
commit such an act of folly?”</p>

<p>“As early as I can remember,” said Charles thoughtfully,
“my father took me with him on his hunting
expeditions. He was very popular with the Indians,
delighted in sport of every kind; and I grew accustomed to the freedom. I was more at home in an
Indian wigwam than at Alpha Marsh. There I was
impatient of restraint. I set myself against a regular
life with the headstrong self-will of youth; and when
my father died it was worse still. More was then
expected of me. I was the heir, and had to stay at
home and attend to the business of the settlement.
Father Nat humoured me, Roger and Loïs screened
me; but it was of no use, I was like a spoilt child. I
wanted my own way, my liberty, and nothing short
of it could satisfy me. Besides, my sympathies were
enlisted on the side of the French. You know I am
descended from a Chevalier de Langlade, one of the
earliest French colonists, and I considered, and do still
consider, that by right of pre-occupation Canada
belongs to France and not to England; and yet for
no consideration would I have served under the present
Canadian Government. I am willing to fight for
France freely and independently, but not with those
who are robbing her and virtually bringing about her
ruin. This was my excuse to my own conscience for
breaking the bonds which had become irksome to me;
and yet I loved my mother and sisters&#8212;above all,
Loïs; and of Roger I cannot speak. I do not think,
if I had realised how completely this contemplated act
of mine would have parted us, I should have had the
courage to go through with it. But I imagined time
would reconcile him to the change, and that he would
continue to join our hunting parties and visit me in
my wigwam; instead of which he entirely withdrew
himself, and after the expedition against Old Britain
it was open enmity between us. From that time to
this he has waged incessant war against the tribes. He
is greatly feared; his name is coupled with a sort of
superstitious terror, and his unusual strength, and the
way in which he always manages to escape capture,
tend to make the Indians believe him invulnerable, and
so they are set upon destroying him. When I joined
the Indians my first act was to marry Nadjii, the chief
Ominipeg’s daughter.”</p>

<p>He said this in a low voice, with averted head.</p>

<p>“You mean to say you deliberately married one of
those wild Indian women?” exclaimed Montcalm.</p>

<p>“Yes, in all honour, according to Indian rites, I took
Nadjii for my squaw. We have a son. I am irrevocably
bound to her,” he continued. “Fully as I recognise the
mistake I have made, I would not have you misjudge
her. Nadjii is no wild Indian woman: she is very
gentle, tender, and true; her devotion to me is
unbounded. I believe she would lay down her life for
me. No, she is not to blame; if a wrong has been
done it has been of my own doing, and in all honour
I must abide by it.”</p>

<p>“I pity you with all my heart,” said the General.</p>

<p>“I never felt the need of pity until now,” answered
the hunter. “Of course you cannot understand the
charms of such a life as I have led for nearly seven
years. It is purely physical. To gallop over the
prairies, to hunt in the forests, to penetrate into
mountain fastnesses and deep, glorious valleys&#8212;no
one who has not partaken of it can conceive the delight
of such an existence. The mere fact of living is
in itself a joy. You, with your high European civilisation,
have mental and intellectual enjoyments; but
we colonists have nothing of all that&#8212;we know only
the primitive pleasures of hunting, fishing, and warfare.
And then there is a strange poetry, a wonderful charm,
in this Indian life. To lie in a birch canoe throughout
the calm summer days upon the bosom of some great
inland lake, to cast the line into its deep, pellucid
waters, and, gazing down into its depths, watch the
trout glide shadowy and silent over the glistening
pebbles, has a mysterious fascination; or, again, to
explore the forests, floating down rivers or lakes beneath
the shadows of moss-bearded firs, to drag the
canoes up on the sandy beach, and, lighting the camp
fire, recline beneath the trees, and smoke and laugh away
the sultry hours, in a lazy luxury of enjoyment, indescribable,
and which you cannot realise, but which I have
lived and revelled in, forgetful, alas? that there are
higher duties incumbent upon man than mere personal
indulgence. And now I reap the bitter fruit. If I had
remained at my post, all this would not have happened.”</p>

<p>“But where was the Ranger?” asked Montcalm.</p>

<p>“In October he was, you know, somewhere up by
Ticonderoga. You remember he had a skirmish with
one of our scouting parties about that time?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Montcalm, “and he punished our men
terribly, driving them back with such heavy loss that
I determined that for the winter, at least, no more
scouting parties should be sent out. But now what
are your plans? What do you propose doing?”</p>

<p>“I came to let you know that I am going down
to the Marshes to reconnoitre, and see with my own
eyes the extent of the misfortune. As you say, there
may be exaggeration in the account I have received,
which was by no means through a direct channel.
You will not begin operations till March, and I shall
be back long before that.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” answered the General; “for I depend
greatly upon you to keep the Indians in order. I
expect the English will attack us by way of Lakes
Champlain and Ontario; in any case, I am preparing
even now to resist them.”</p>

<p>“I am more inclined to think they will attack
Quebec itself.”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” answered Montcalm; “the navigation of
the St. Lawrence is too difficult and dangerous for
any hostile fleet to attempt. Besides, the position of
Quebec renders it impregnable unless we are betrayed.
I have a plan of defence which will prevent the enemy
approaching Quebec.”</p>

<p>“I am satisfied to believe such to be the case,” said
Charles; “and now, farewell, sir; you may trust me to
be back before the rivers and lakes are unthawed.”</p>

<p>“Will you not stay to supper?” said Montcalm. “We
are alone; all my officers are dancing attendance upon
the Quebec ladies.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered Charles; “I have still certain
things to settle with the chiefs, and I start to-morrow before dawn. I must therefore take leave of
you now. Farewell, Mademoiselle,” he said, approaching
Mercèdes.</p>

<p>“Adieu,” she answered; and for one second as their
fingers touched their eyes met. He bowed his head
over her hand; then turned away, and, with a hurried
salutation to the General, left the room.</p>

</h2>


<p>The moon was shining brightly on the snow-covered
earth, causing the outlines of the houses and
buildings of the Marshes to stand forth in bold relief,
while the snow hid under its whiteness the ruins of
the late invasion. Not a sound was heard; perfect
stillness reigned over the land, even as it reigns in the
chamber of death where the still figure lies beneath
the white shroud, soon to be put away out of sight,
until the dawn of the great resurrection day, when
earth and sea shall give up their dead.</p>

<p>In springtime the earth bursts forth, leaf and bud
and flower, and the heart of man rejoices and is made
glad. Surely it is but the shadow of that joy which
shall be ours when the graves shall give up their
dead, and we shall see our loved ones glorified,
made perfect, released from the bondage of earth,
knowing but one law, the great law of Love, by
the divine power of which their chains have been
broken and they have been loosed. Truly then, and
then only, shall we give utterance to the cry, “O
death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy
victory?”</p>

<p>Oh! how the heart aches and strains after that consummation.
Our loved ones, who are gone before,
whose spirits are still with us by night and by day,
in the busy crowd as in the solitude of our chamber,
whose voices we long to hear, whose hands we long to
press&#8212;what agony of patient waiting!</p>

<p>But there was one standing out in the snow looking
up at the Marshes travel-stained and worn, not daring
to approach the home of his fathers. He had come
many miles over a trackless country, over ice-bound
rivers, through deep forests, over mountains and valleys
covered with snow, enduring hardships which would
have seemed intolerable to a less hardy nature, until
at last he stood before the home of his childhood;
and tears blinded his eyes when he saw that it was
not utterly destroyed, that all had not perished, that
still the village steeple rose in the moonlight, telling
of God’s mercy.</p>

<p>Suddenly the loud bark of the house-dog warned
him that, unless he retreated, his presence would be
discovered. He had been standing in the high road;
he moved quickly behind a clump of trees, only just
in time. The front door opened, and a stream of
light poured forth as Marcus stepped out on to the
garden path and looked around, cautiously peering
into the dark shadows cast by the house and the trees.
He heard him say, “I can see no one. Had I better
let Bob loose?” The dog’s bark had changed into
a whine, which Charles Langlade knew full well to
mean that his instinct had discovered a friend, not
a foe, in the night watcher.</p>

<p>“It might be as well,” said a woman’s voice; and a
second later there was a rush and a bound, and Charles
Langlade felt two great paws upon his shoulders, and
a loud whine of welcome went up into the still night
air.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” asked Marcus, in a clear, loud
voice.</p>

<p>“Down, Bob; down, old boy,” said Charles, stepping
out of the shadow; and crossing the road, he opened
the wicket gate and entered.</p>

<p>“Marcus!”</p>

<p>“Charles!”</p>

<p>And the two brothers clasped hands.</p>

<p>“My poor boy! Will you ever forgive me?” said
the elder.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to forgive,” answered Marcus;
“you did what you thought right.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I did what pleased me,” answered
Charles. “But tell me who is living and who is
dead?”</p>

<p>At this moment Loïs came out of the house.</p>

<p>“Oh, Charles, my brother!” and her arms were
round his neck.</p>

<p>The three stood there in the snow, so deeply moved
they could give no utterance to their feelings, and Bob
leapt around them, giving vent to his delight in short,
sharp barks.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Loïs. “We have so much to tell
you.”</p>

<p>“My mother, the children?” said Charles.</p>

<p>“Are unhurt,” said Loïs.</p>

<p>“And Father Nat?”</p>

<p>“Ah! that is the worst of all; still, he is living.
Come,” and she drew him across the threshold of what
had been his home; and as he stood once more in the
old familiar place, the glamour fell from his eyes, and
he exclaimed bitterly,&#8212;</p>

<p>“How could I forsake you?”</p>

<p>The front kitchen was empty; but there was fire on
the hearth, and the lighted lamp showed Loïs how
worn and travel-stained he was. His face was thin and
haggard, his lips shrivelled with exposure and cold;
his bearskin partially hid the dilapidated condition of
his clothes. He drew near the fire and stretched out
his hands to the flame. Marcus, looking at him,
said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“You will eat, Charles?”</p>

<p>“I have had no food since yesterday,” he said; “my
provisions have come to an end, and there is no game
abroad in this weather.”</p>

<p>“Sit down and warm yourself,” said Loïs, pushing
him gently into the chair which had been his
father’s. “All are gone to rest. I will get your
supper.”</p>

<p>“Tell me first what of Father Nat. Does Roger
know?”</p>

<p>“Father Nat was terribly wounded,” said Loïs; “and
for a long time we despaired of saving him; but within
the last fortnight there have been signs of gradual
improvement; he has seemed to recognise us at times.
But now ask no more until you are refreshed,” and she
left the kitchen, whilst Marcus filled a pipe and handed
it to his brother.</p>

<p>“It is the calumet of peace,” he said.</p>

<p>“You heap coals of fire on my head.”</p>

<p>But nature was so exhausted that he sank back in
his chair, and, putting the pipe to his lips, slowly
smoked.</p>

<p>The relief of finding that those nearest and dearest
to him were living was so great, that in his weariness
he seemed powerless to realise anything more; mind
and body were alike benumbed; and when Loïs brought
in the supper they had to rouse him and force him to
eat. It was evident he had no idea of what had
occurred, by the words to which he had already given
utterance. After he had eaten, looking up at Loïs, he
said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“I heard the settlement was burnt to the ground,
and you were all slain. The man who told me said he
was an eye-witness, and had fled when the village was
in flames.”</p>

<p>“But for Nadjii’s warning and Roger’s sudden
arrival, such would have been the case,” answered
Loïs.</p>

<p>“Nadjii! what had Nadjii to do with it?” said Charles
sharply.</p>

<p>“She told me you had bidden her watch over us. She
came to me, and gave us notice that the Indians were
coming to attack us; and so they did not surprise
us, and we were able to defend ourselves until Roger
came. It seems he had been warned by one of her
people.”</p>

<p>“My true-hearted Nadjii, my brave little
squaw!” said Charles, his whole face lighting up
with pleasure and emotion. “Where is she? What
has become of her? Has she returned to her
tribe?”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence; he was quick to notice
it.</p>

<p>“What has become of her? Where is she?” he
asked hastily.</p>

<p>“She saved my life, she saved Father Nat’s life,&#8212;she
died for us;” and standing before him, Loïs burst
into tears.</p>

<p>He started; every particle of colour forsook his
face.</p>

<p>“Tell me all,” he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>And Marcus told him, for Loïs could not, how Nadjii
had covered them with her own body, and how she had
been wounded unto death.</p>

<p>“And the child?” said Charles, burying his face
in his hands. “She would not have left it behind.”</p>

<p>Again there was a moment’s silence; then Loïs
knelt down beside him, and, laying her hand on his
arm, said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“When she was dying, she told us where to find it&#8212;in
the trunk of a tree in the forest where she had
laid it. Roger went to fetch it.”</p>

<p>“Roger did that?” exclaimed Charles. “Let me
see my boy, Loïs!”</p>

<p>She hesitated just for one moment, then continued
slowly, not daring to raise her tearful eyes to his
face,&#8212;</p>

<p>“He looked for the child carefully; he found the spot
where Nadjii had told him the babe was, but it was
gone.”</p>

<p>Charles sprang up. “Stolen!” he exclaimed, his eyes
flashing.</p>

<p>“We fear so,” said Loïs. “Certainly there was no
trace of any bodily harm having befallen him; he had
simply been taken away.”</p>

<p>“Did Nadjii know of this before she died?” asked
Charles, with set teeth.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Loïs; “she thought she saw him.
Her last words were ‘Jesus, Nenemoosha.’ Was she
a Christian, Charles?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank God, I taught her all she could understand,”
he answered, “and her gentle soul delighted in
the stories of Christ’s love. She was a better Christian
than many who enjoy far greater privileges than did
my squaw wife. I am glad she thought the child was
safe. The Indians must have found and taken him. If
they have wrought him harm, then his mother’s tribe
will avenge him. He was such a bonnie two-year-old
boy, Loïs;” and as one oppressed with a weight of
sorrow, he let his head sink on to his bosom, and
heavy tears fell from his eyes. It was the strong
man’s agony.</p>

<p>His past life of physical enjoyment, without thought
of the morrow, was fading as a mirage fades away
even as he gazed, and his soul was steeped in stern
reality. Ruin and death were around him. He had
deemed himself all-powerful, capable of choosing his
own way, shaping his own course, unmindful of any will
save his own. A rebellious son! Even as the prodigal
he had gone forth in the pride of his youth and manhood,
feeling himself strong, and he had wasted his
life, forgetful, or ignorant perhaps, that there is in
man, made in God’s image, a higher, nobler nature than
in the brute creation. Soul, heart, intellect, are surely
given to bring the body into subjection&#8212;not doing
away with material enjoyment, but tempering it; and
as years go on we recognise that our bodies are but
the caskets made to contain the never-dying spirit
which God breathed into man, even the breath of
life.</p>

<p>“My son was dead and is alive again.” Dead,
though full of life and health, clothed in rich raiment,
going forth, having gathered together all his substance,
rich in friends and in all the world can give; yet he
was dead!</p>

<p>“Alive again!” when hungry and athirst, his rich
raiment in tatters, his head bowed in sorrow, and his
lips giving utterance to the words, “Father, I have
sinned against Heaven and before thee!” And his
father rejoiced over him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Charles rose to his feet, threw one arm
round Loïs, and drew her close up to him.</p>

<p>“Dearest,” he said, “if I have sinned in the past,
God pardon me! I will find the boy and bring him
to you; and when this war is over I will come home,
and ease the burden from your shoulders, Marcus, so
that you may take up your calling and be a minister
of God, according to your heart’s desire, and I will care
for our mother and the younger ones, and strive to do
my duty in the land, as you, my younger brother, have
done in my stead.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand to Marcus, who grasped it,
saying,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Why not stay with us now, Charles?”</p>

<p>“Because my honour is pledged,” he answered.
“Not to the Indians; I shall never again dwell among
them or be one with them; but to Canada, to General
Montcalm. I have sworn to stand by him to the end,
and I will do so, not as an Indian chief if I can help it.
I shall join the Canadian militia as a volunteer, as I
ought to have done from the first, and fight for the
cause which I still believe to be the right one.
Tell Roger this; he will understand. And now let
me have one look at Father Nat, after which I will
lie down and sleep, for I am terribly weary. I have
been three weeks on the road from Montreal, and must
return as quickly as possible. Is Roger still here to
protect you?”</p>

<p>“He will not leave us till the spring,” said Marcus.
“He is gone now for a couple of days to Cauterets on
business; when he does go for good he will leave
us well protected. You need not fear; we have sentries
out by night and by day now.”</p>

<p>“It is well; let me see Father Nat,” said Charles;
and they led the way to the room where Nathaniel
Boscowen lay sleeping. Shading the lamp she carried
in her hand, Loïs approached the bed, and was surprised
to see that his eyes were open and that he
moved restlessly.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Loïs?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, father,” she answered; “shall I arrange your
pillows?” and signing to the two young men to keep
in the shadow, she bent over him.</p>

<p>He lifted his hand. “My pillows are all right,” he
said; “but I heard voices in the room below, and it
seemed to me I recognised Charles’s. I would it were
so; I loved the lad: if only I might see him before I
die!”</p>

<p>“You are not going to die, Father Nat; you are
getting well, and will be as hale and hearty as ever.
Do you wish to see Charles so very much?” said
Loïs.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Nathaniel shortly, as if the question
irritated him.</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you something. It was his voice
you heard; he is here,” said Loïs.</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Father Nat, trying to lift his head,
but Charles was quickly beside him.</p>

<p>“Dear Father Nat,” he said, “forgive me.”</p>

<p>“Ay, my lad, I forgive thee,” and he clasped his
hand. “I always told you they were a treacherous
people. You will come back to us now?”</p>

<p>“Please God I will,” said Charles.</p>

<p>“Then I am content. The breach is healed; Langlade
and Boscowen are not riven!” and closing his
eyes, he settled himself to sleep. They watched him
for a few minutes, and then crept softly out of the
room.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.1em'>TO THE FORE</span>
</h2>


<p>At the first sign of spring, General Montcalm
prepared to take the field and oppose a steady
resistance to an attack which it was generally believed
would be made upon Quebec by way of Lakes Champlain
and Ontario.</p>

<p>He was sitting in his tent one afternoon, in company
with General Bougainville and Chevalier Levis. On
a table before them maps were spread out, and Montcalm
was explaining his plan of defence, supposing the
English should attempt a regular siege of Quebec.</p>

<p>“I do not believe it possible for the English to
approach the town,” he said. “All round, on the high
ground overlooking it, I shall station the principal part
of the army; the right wing will extend along the river
St. Charles and the left on to Montmorenci; by this
means our troops will cover an area of from seven to
eight miles. The steep ground rises almost from the
water’s edge, and the guns from the citadel itself will
do the rest. Are you not both of my opinion?”</p>

<p>“We are,” said Levis. “If we can hold out till the
winter, I believe we shall see the last of the English.”</p>

<p>Even while he was speaking, voices were heard outside
the tent, and the sentinel, looking in, said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“A soldier with a despatch for the General.”</p>

<p>“Let him come in,” said Montcalm, looking up.</p>

<p>A Canadian, recognisable as such by his dress,
entered. He was covered with dust, and had evidently
ridden hard. He laid a letter on the table before the
General.</p>

<p>“Who has sent you?” asked Montcalm, as he opened
the despatch.</p>

<p>“Captain Langlade,” was the ready answer.</p>

<p>The General’s face grew visibly sterner as he read,
and when he had finished, he laid the letter on the
table, kept his hand upon it, and said emphatically,&#8212;</p>

<p>“The decisive moment is approaching, gentlemen.
This letter is to inform me that the English with a
great fleet are within three leagues of Quebec; they
have on board a large army, commanded by the young
General Wolfe. We know full well what sort of man
he is! The fate of Canada is now in the balance.”</p>

<p>“And you will come forth victorious, General, as you
did at Fort William Henry and Ticonderoga,” said
Levis.</p>

<p>“God grant it!” answered the General. “I think
our measures are well taken,” he said, turning to
the two officers. “In my opinion, unless there be
treason in the camp, the English will never make
themselves masters of the town. I believe it to be
impregnable.”</p>

<p>“I am certain that, with intrenchments, I could hold
the city with three or four thousand men,” said Bougainville;
adding, “In a few days we shall muster
sixteen thousand men in and round its walls. There is
nothing to fear; let the English come!”</p>

<p>“I am satisfied you are right,” answered the
General.</p>

<p>Then, turning to the man who had brought the
message, he said, “You will return at once to Captain
Langlade, and tell him we shall join the army at
Quebec as quickly as possible. And now, gentlemen,
we will call a general council of officers, and then
to-morrow at dawn <i>en route</i>; we are approaching the
end.”</p>

<p>“And a good thing too,” said Bougainville. “We
have shilly-shallied long enough. It is time the
English understood once for all that we intend to
remain masters of Canada, and to hold the fortress
upon which old Samuel Champlain first planted the
French flag.”</p>

<p>The following day the whole forces of the French
and Colonial army were on their way to Quebec. Only
three battalions were left at Ticonderoga, and a strong
detachment placed so as to resist any possible attack
by Lake Ontario. The French took up positions at
the mouth of the St. Charles on the east, and the
river Montmorenci on the north-east, which Montcalm
had fortified with the greatest possible skill. Across
the mouth of the St. Charles a boom of logs chained
together was placed, protected by mounted cannon.
A bridge of boats crossing the river connected the
city with the camp. All the gates of Quebec except
that of St. Charles were closed and barricaded. A
hundred and six cannon were mounted on the walls,
whilst on the river there was a floating battery of
twelve heavy pieces, a number of gunboats, and eight
fireships.</p>

<p>The army for the defence mustered, they posted
sixteen thousand men, for the most part advantageously,
behind defensive works. A large portion of these
were Canadians, who were of little use in the open
field, but fought well behind intrenchments; there
were also upwards of a thousand Indians from the
brave tribes of the Iroquois, or five nations. It was
at the end of June, and the country round Quebec,
naturally fertile, was in the height of its summer glory.
On the curving shore from the St. Charles to the rocky
gorge of Montmorenci, for a distance of seven to eight
miles, were to be seen the whitewashed dwellings of
the parish of Beauport, and the fields on both sides
studded with tents, huts, and Indian wigwams. Midway
between the little river of Beauport, on a rising
ground, stood a large stone house, round which tents
were thickly clustered. Here Montcalm had his headquarters.</p>

<p>Looking down upon her defenders, Quebec sat perched
upon her rock, a congregation of stone houses, palaces,
convents, and hospitals; the uniformity being broken
by the green trees of the seminary gardens, the spires
of the cathedral, the Convent of the Ursulines, and the
monastic buildings of the Recollets and the Jesuits.
A firm, solid mass she looked in the summer sunshine,
unconquered, and it seemed unconquerable. A lovable
town, quaint even then, with its one-storied houses,
built heavily of stone and stuccoed brick, with two
dormer windows full of house plants in each roof.
Here and there, higher still, a weather-worn wood-coloured
gallery was seen, pent-roofed and balustered,
geraniums showing through the balusters, and white
doves circling around and cooing upon the windowsills.
Such as she was in her homely fashion, French
and English alike looked up to her&#8212;the one with
loving pride, the other with covetous desire.</p>

<p>On the 26th of June the English fleet anchored off
the Island of Orleans, a few miles below Quebec. A
small party attempting to land was opposed by the
Canadians, but they were beaten off, and the whole
army then landed.</p>

<p>When William Pitt gave the command of the
English army in Canada to General Wolfe, it was
but natural that such an act should arouse feelings
of jealousy in men older than himself, and under
whose orders he had served in the earlier part of the
campaign. Wolfe himself was more alive to the
responsibility than to the honour which was almost
thrust upon him. The state of his health was most
precarious; in fact, he was rarely free from acute pain,
and it required an immense power of self-command and
energy to enable him to bear up against fatigue and
mental anxiety. Nevertheless, he had accepted the
command unhesitatingly, and with the determination
of conquering Quebec and adding this new jewel to the
English crown.</p>

<p>To accomplish this he knew that half measures were
no longer feasible. From the end of the Island of
Orleans he could see and judge the full strength of the
enemy; three great batteries frowned down upon him
from above Quebec, behind which rose the redoubts and
parapets of Cape Diamond, whilst three other batteries
down to the river’s edge guarded the lower part of the
town. The whole country round was covered with
earthworks, redoubts, and intrenchments; the river
with floating batteries, fireships, and other engines
of war. His first act was to issue a proclamation in
the king’s name:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“His Excellency Major-General James Wolfe, Commander-in-Chief
of his Britannic Majesty’s troops now
stationed in the river St. Lawrence, to the people of
Canada.</p>

<p>“My king and master George III., justly irritated
against France, has resolved to humble her pride
and to revenge the insults she has inflicted on the
English colonies. With this purpose in view he has
sent me, at the head of a formidable army, with a fleet
which has already advanced almost into the centre of
their chief city, to deprive France of all her establishments
in North America, and to proclaim British rule.
This is my mission, and by the grace of God I hope to
carry it into effect.</p>

<div style='text-align:right'>“<span class='sc'>James Wolfe.</span>”</div>

</blockquote>

<p>This done, he took possession of Point Levis, a
promontory on the south bank of the St. Lawrence,
where the current narrows into a deep stream of only
a mile in breadth. General Monckton occupied this
point with four battalions, and shelled the lower town
across the river, but the citadel was beyond his reach.
Wolfe’s army consisted of nine thousand troops: it
should have amounted to fourteen thousand, but at
the last moment the orders for some of the West Indian
troops to join were countermanded; this was probably
partly due to jealousy at Wolfe’s having been
nominated to the chief command.</p>

<p>The two armies were stationed opposite each other
on either side of the river. Vaudreuil, as Governor
of Canada, still held command, and by his mistakes
frequently hampered Montcalm’s action. Had he
planted guns in such a manner as to fire down on
the English fleet, it could never have taken up a
position so near the city; he failed to do this, however,
and the result was that the English fleet passed up the
river in safety, to the astonishment of the Canadians,
who, until then, had believed it impossible for large
ships to be brought up the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>Again, very shortly after the landing of the English
army on the Island of Orleans, Vaudreuil made a
desperate attempt to destroy the English fleet by
launching fireships against it. The English sentries
at the farther end of the island saw in the middle of
the night vessels coming down the river. These ships
were really filled with pitch, tar, and all sorts of
combustibles mixed with shells and grenades, and the decks
crowded with a number of cannon crammed with grape
shot and musket balls. Suddenly they became like
pillars of flame, and advanced with tremendous explosion
and noise. But the French officers had lost their nerve,
and set fire to the ships too soon. The English, after
their first surprise, recovered their coolness, lowered
their boats, and the sailors rowed out to meet the fireships,
and by means of grapnels they towed them
towards land, where they were stranded and left to burn
themselves out.</p>

<p>Thus the fight might truly be said to have begun.
To lookers on, and at this distance of time, it almost bears
the aspect of a duel, the two principal actors standing
out boldly in relief, fighting not for themselves, but
for their countries, and, to a certain extent, for their
religion. Catholic France, Protestant England! Noble
men in every sense of the word, worthy of each other,
their names have come down to posterity linked together&#8212;“Wolfe
and Montcalm.”</p>

</h2>


<p>General Montcalm was slowly pacing up and
down the room he occupied at his headquarters on
the St. Charles; the only other person present was Langlade,
called by courtesy Captain Langlade. A look of
great annoyance was on the General’s face.</p>

<p>“You cannot do this,” he said. “What you have
engaged to accomplish you must carry out to the end.
If you withdraw yourself from the Indians, you will do
our cause incalculable harm. They know you; they
obey you; you are a power with them. With the
Canadians you are no one; they have their own officers.
In my opinion, you are bound to retain your present
position until the end of the campaign; the wrongs
you deplore would be greatly increased if your influence
were withdrawn. I entreat of you, make no change
at the present critical moment. As far as lies in my
power, I will lighten your duties; but you must remain
with your Indians, to hold them in hand and to
restrain them.”</p>

<p>“I have promised my people I would have nothing
further in common with the Indians,” said Charles.</p>

<p>“You pledged yourself first to me,” said the General.
“You cannot desert me; you would do far greater harm
by withdrawing yourself. I entreat of you not to do
this thing.” And he went up to the young man, and
took his hand with the persuasive eloquence for which
he was so noted.</p>

<p>Charles knew full well that the General was right;
that, once his authority removed, the Indians would
be more difficult than ever to hold under restraint,
and that their natural cruelty would have free scope.
Scalps without number! they had no other ambition.
The Iroquois, if they were foremost in war and in
eloquence, were also foremost in savage acts. They
were proud to have a white man as their leader, and
would revenge his desertion, perhaps even by withdrawing
themselves from the French cause. He
realised for the first time how difficult it is to retrace
false steps, and to undo wrongdoing. He had joined
himself to the Indians, he had sworn to serve the French
cause, of his own free will and for his own personal
ends: was he justified in withdrawing himself at so
critical a moment for reasons equally personal? His
sense of justice told him he was not. After a few
minutes’ reflection, during which the General watched
him anxiously, he said, in serious, measured tones,
very different from the eager, impetuous voice of
old,&#8212;</p>

<p>“I will remain with you. I have done harm enough
already. It is no longer with me a question of right,
but what is least wrong. I have studied my own
inclinations all my life; now I am going against
them.”</p>

<p>“And you do well, believe me,” said Montcalm.
“No one can hate the Indians more than I do; my
whole soul recoils from them. How you ever came to
join them has been a wonder to me; but having done
so, it is but fair that you should remain at your post
until the war is over. I should never know an hour’s
tranquillity if you were not their leader. Thank you
for your decision; some day I may perhaps find means
of proving my gratitude.”</p>

<p>“You could render me a service now at once, if you
would,” said Charles.</p>

<p>“Name it,” answered the General.</p>

<p>“I told you I had a son,” said Charles quickly;
“his mother died trying to save the Marshes. She
had carried the child with her in her long journeyings,
and when the Indians attacked the village, she hid
him in the trunk of a tree while she went to the rescue.
When the fray was over she told my sister Loïs where
to find the child, but when she sent to look for it, it
had disappeared. I have been a long time tracing it,
but at last discovered that a half-brother of Nadjii’s,
the lad who had warned Roger of the meditated attack,
had found the child, brought it up here, and given it
in charge of a Huron woman, living at Lorette. At
first I doubted the story; but I went to see the child
two days ago, and recognised him as my son. I cannot
leave him where he is&#8212;it is not safe; and, moreover,
I never wish him to know that he has Indian blood in
his veins. I have thought that at the Convent of the
Ursulines they would take him in, and care for him, if
you would obtain admission for him.”</p>

<p>“Nothing can be simpler,” answered Montcalm.
“You know that three months ago Mercèdes entered
as a novice. After that affair of Montreal I never
allowed her to return to Madame Péan: indeed, she
had no desire to do so; she begged me to let her enter
the convent at once. In fact, she pined and drooped
from that time, until I brought her back to Quebec,
and she and Marthe both entered the Ursulines
together. Since then she has recovered, and whenever
I can manage to find time to go and see her,
she is as bright and happy as I can wish. Yes,
certainly, I will give you a letter to the Superior. Take
your child there; it will be well cared for. I will write
it at once;” and sitting down, he drew the writing
materials towards him. “There,” he said, handing the
letter to Charles, “if you present yourself to-morrow,
and ask to see the Superior in my name, you will gain
admittance. Give her this. I have explained everything;
the child will be safe there.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Charles; “and now I will leave
you. I shall be in Quebec to-morrow. You may trust
me; I am yours until the war is over,” he added.</p>

<p>“I have your word,” answered Montcalm; “surely
that is enough,” and accompanying him to the door,
they shook hands, and then he watched the young
man go down the hill-side, on his way to the Indian
quarters.</p>

<p>“A fine fellow, but a ruined life,” he thought.
“Thank goodness I have persuaded him to remain
with his Indians; the game would have been as good
as played out if he had deserted us.”</p>

<p>It was early morning as Charles Langlade strode
rapidly along the road leading from the hamlet of
Lorette to Quebec. Through meadows and rye-fields
it wound, crossing and recrossing the swift St. Charles,
a somewhat lonely road with a few cottages scattered
here and there, and irregular, shabby-looking cabins
along the lanes, at the doors of which lounged Indian
boys and girls of all shades and colours. This was the
Huron village of Lorette. They were Christians after
their fashion, the poor remnant of the mighty Huron
nation, converted by the Jesuits and crushed by the
Iroquois in the far western wilderness.</p>

<p>But Charles Langlade was not alone. He carried on
his shoulder a boy of some three years old. The two
resembled each other most curiously, except that the
child’s skin was still fair and soft, whilst the father’s
was bronzed and weather-beaten. There were the
same deep blue eyes and curling chestnut hair, the
same pose of the head slightly tossed back. They
looked very picturesque, the hunter in his crimson
shirt, one arm raised, holding the half-naked child, who
sat proudly aloft, clutching at his father’s hair, beating
his little bare feet against the broad chest, and laughing
aloud for glee; so bubbling over with life, that the
passers-by turned to look back at them.</p>

<p>It was a goodly sight; and so they reached the
heavy stone gateway leading into the city, set thick
with mighty bolts and spikes. Here Charles Langlade
paused, and showed his pass before he could gain
admittance; but he was not detained long, and went
his way through a squalid lane, the old “Sault au
Matelot,” looking its best this bright summer morning,
creeping under the shelter of the city walls and
overhanging rock, from which drooped weeds and
grass, with just a few rays of sunlight penetrating
here and there, glistening on the abundant moisture
which slowly trickled down, until at last he reached
the flight of steps leading from the lower to the upper
town, and having climbed them stood at the convent
gates. He paused a moment before pulling the great
bell, lifted the child from off his shoulder, and placed it
on the ground. As it stood thus beside him he looked
at it, and passed his hand over the rough curly head,
straightening the short crimson cotton blouse, which,
with innumerable strings of coloured beads round its
neck, was all the clothes it boasted; then with an
impatient sigh he pulled the rope dangling at the
gateway. The sound rang through the silent court
and garden, and presently a small panel was pushed
on one side, and a voice asked,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Who is there?”</p>

<p>“From his Excellency General Montcalm. I am
the bearer of a letter to the reverend mother,” said
Langlade.</p>

<p>The little panel was clapped quickly to again, and
he heard the receding footsteps of the doorkeeper.</p>

<p>He was not kept long waiting. This time the little
door let into the big gateway was unbarred, and he was
bidden to enter; and, after she had carefully rebolted
the door, the nun preceded him through the garden,
full of flowers, clumps of lilac bushes, roses, and hollyhocks,
blossoming within the shelter of the high
surrounding walls, while the bright morning sun poured
down on the alleys and greensward with all the glory
of the short Canadian summer.</p>

<p>He was ushered into a long whitewashed room, the
only furniture of which was a deal table, a few common
chairs, and a tall crucifix on the wall.</p>

<p>The nun pointed to a chair, and disappeared with
that soft gliding movement habitual to her class; but
Charles Langlade, picking the child up, carried it to the
open window and looked out on the quiet scene; and
as he caught a glimpse of black robes moving among
the trees, he wondered in his secret heart if Mercèdes
were there. A strange longing had been upon him all
that day to see her face once more, and then&#8212;well,
then it would be over.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a tall thin woman in black
robes and veil, her face framed in white linen, entered
noiselessly. Behind her was another figure dressed in
the same fashion, only she wore a long white robe and
veil; her face was very pale and her eyes downcast,
but in her Charles Langlade recognised Mercèdes; and
thus it was these two stood once more in each other’s
presence.</p>

<p>“I have read the General’s letter, Mr. Langlade, and
understand that you wish to leave your child with us
for a time. You can do so; we will take all care of
it, and when this terrible war is over you can claim it
of us.”</p>

<p>So said the reverend mother, and advancing, she
tried to take the little hand; but the child, terrified,
clung to his father, uttering Indian words indicative
of fear at the strange figure before him, such as he had
never seen before.</p>

<p>“He will soon get accustomed to us,” said the
mother gently. “Sister Mercèdes, will you try your
influence?”</p>

<p>Charles whispered a few words to the boy, and,
sitting down, placed him on his knee, and as Mercèdes
approached, he said,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, your father bade me enquire after
your health and well-being.”</p>

<p>“Tell my dear father I am well and happy,” she
answered; “and that we pray unceasingly for his
success.”</p>

<p>She spoke quite calmly, and the colour had come
back into her face.</p>

<p>“I will not forget,” he answered; then again he
spoke to the child. The boy looked up at the young
novice, who, trembling slightly, held out her arms and
smiled upon him, speaking a few soft words such as she
had been wont to use to her little sister at home, and
he answered with a wild cry, like a bird.</p>

<p>“He is only a little savage; you must tame him,”
said Charles, rising and placing the child in her arms;
and bowing low before her and the mother, he went
towards the door. He paused one second on the threshold,
and the last thing he saw was the white figure of
the nun, clasping in her arms the child in its red robe
and gaudy beads.</p>

<p>Would they ever meet again?</p>

</h2>


<p>Late one evening Loïs was startled by an Indian
youth creeping round the house. Going out to
him, he gave her a folded paper, which proved to be a
letter from Charles. It ran thus:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Yes, Loïs, I have found the boy, and I have placed
him in safety in the Ursuline Convent in Quebec, with
Mercèdes Montcalm. When the war is over, if you
will have him he shall be conveyed to you; at present
it would be impossible to do so with any safety. After
my assurance to you that I would separate myself
from the Indians, you will be surprised to hear that at
General Montcalm’s entreaty I have retained my command.
He represented to me, and I think justly, that
I had no right for any private consideration, any personal
quarrel, to bring disunion into his army, which,
by throwing up my Indian command, and attaching
myself to the Canadian contingent, I should most
assuredly do. It would be a breach of honour. My
first engagement was made to him. The Indians are
only held in check by my influence; if that were removed,
their cruelty and licence would be unbounded.</p>

<p>“All this I know to be true, and therefore I have decided
not to inflict further wrong on others; what is done I
must abide by. Bitterly as I deplore the past, at the
present moment I feel bound to those who, knowing
nothing of my private life, have placed confidence in
me. It cannot last long. General Wolfe is pushing
on towards Quebec, but our positions are strong. It is
now July. In less than three months the winter will
force the English to retreat, probably to return to
England; the Indians will then disperse and I shall
be released. In the meantime, I am almost face to
face with Roger. I am stationed with General Levis
on the heights of Montmorenci, and I have every
reason to believe that Roger, with his Rangers, is in
the forest, trying to discover a ford across the river.
We are on the same search. If it be so, we can scarcely
do otherwise than meet one day. Pray for us, Loïs,
and that this cruel war may end, and that we may
once more all dwell together in peace!</p>

<div style='text-align:right; margin-right:4em;'>“Your loving brother,</div>
<div style='text-align:right'>”<span class='sc'>Charles Langlade</span>.</div>

<p class='ni'>“P.S.&#8212;An Indian will be the bearer of this letter;
you may trust him to send me back news of what is
going on at the Marshes. I am watching over you;
you need fear no fresh aggression.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The question of this ford, alluded to in the above
letter, was of great importance, and it was only discovered
after many days of close watching by the French.
Early one morning, General Levis’s <i>aide-de-camp</i>, a
Scotchman, appeared in his tent bringing with him a
peasant, who explained that he had crossed a ford a
few hours earlier.</p>

<p>“Then you shall serve us as guide,” said Levis, and
he told off eleven thousand Canadians under their officer,
Repentigny, with orders to intrench themselves opposite
the ford. Charles Langlade, with four hundred Indians,
went in advance, crossed the ford, and discovered the
English in the forest; not considering himself sufficiently
strong to attack, he returned and told Repentigny,
who sent to Levis, who again sent to Vaudreuil!</p>

<p>The Indians, thinking they would be baulked of their
prey, became mutinous at the delay, and Langlade
found it impossible to restrain them; they declared
that if he would not lead them, they would attack the
Rangers without him, and, to avoid this, he recrossed
the ford.</p>

<p>So savage was their onset that they drove the
Rangers back on the regulars, who, however, stood their
ground and repulsed the Indians with considerable
loss. Nevertheless, they carried off thirty-six scalps.
Montcalm and Vaudreuil determined to remain on the
defensive; the English were powerless to injure them.
Wolfe’s position was a dangerous one; his army was
separated into three parts, at such distances that it
would have been impossible for any one of them to
come to the assistance of the other.</p>

<p>The deep and impassable Montmorenci flowed between
the two camps, but from the cliffs on either side
a gunshot might easily reach and hit a man.</p>

<p>The Canadians were also growing daily more and
more dispirited. They were ready for active service,
but the inaction to which they were condemned tried
their patience severely.</p>

<p>It was summer-time. The harvest was at hand, and
the militia men thought of the crops waiting to be
gathered in. Many deserted and went home to their
villages, notwithstanding the exhortations of their
priests; what was found most efficacious to keep them
from so doing was the Governor’s threat to let the
Indians loose upon any who should waver in their
allegiance.</p>

<p>But in the midst of all these difficulties it was the
characters of the men who stood at the helm which
filled those around them, and indeed their enemies,
with admiration.</p>

<p>Montcalm’s career in Canada was a struggle against
an inexorable destiny. He bore hunger, thirst, and
fatigue without a murmur, caring for his soldiers, but
with no thought for himself. In the midst of general
corruption he stood forth immaculate, having but one
thought, the good of the colony; the savages themselves
declared they learnt from him patience in suffering.</p>

<p>A story is told of an Indian chief, when presented to
Montcalm, expressing his astonishment that a man who
was capable of such great deeds should be so diminutive
in stature.</p>

<p>“Ah! how small thou art!” he exclaimed; then
added, “but I see reflected in thy eyes the height of
the oak and the vivacity of the eagle.”</p>

<p>His own soldiers and his officers worshipped him, but
such men as the Governor Vaudreuil and his satellites,
Bigot, Cadet, and the rest, both hated and feared him,
as the evil man hates and fears the just one.</p>

<p>In the opposite camp a dying man held sway. James
Wolfe knew that he was doomed; and his heart sank
within him as the days went by, and at the end of
July he found himself no nearer taking Quebec than
upon the first day on which he landed. He could not
move Montcalm to attack. On the 31st of July he
made a desperate attempt on the French camp, on the
heights of Montmorenci; but notwithstanding acts of
the most daring courage, the English were driven back
with enormous loss. The blow was such a severe one that
Wolfe, thoroughly disheartened, meditated fortifying
the Île-aux-Coudres, and then sailing for England with
the remainder of his army, to return the following year.
But the following year! could he even reckon on a
month of life? and he had so hoped, when he accepted
his office from William Pitt, to return triumphant, having
blotted out and repaired the faults of his predecessors.
Imbued with an ardent love of glory, what must have
been the feelings of such a man at the prospect of
issuing the order for the army he had expected to lead
to victory to sail homewards&#8212;if not conquered, at least
foiled! He could not make up his mind to such a
step as long as there still remained the shadow of a
chance.</p>

<p>In the middle of August he issued another proclamation,
couched in the following terms:&#8212;</p>

<p>“Seeing that the people of Canada have shown so
little appreciation of my mercy, I am resolved to listen
no longer to the sentiments of humanity which have so
far ruled me. It is a cause of bitter sorrow to me to
be obliged even remotely to imitate the acts of barbarity
perpetrated by the Canadians and Indians; yet in
justice to myself and my army, I feel bound to chastise
the Canadian people. From henceforth therefore any
village or settlement which offers resistance to British
rule will be razed to the ground.”</p>

<p>The churches were to be respected, and women and
children treated with due honour. “If any violence
is offered to a woman, the offender shall be punished
with death.”</p>

<p>The Rangers and Light Infantry were charged to
carry out these orders, and soon on the sunny plains
around Quebec flames and smoke arose from many a
farmhouse and peaceful village, and the population
went forth in flocks, victims of the scourge of war.
The Governor Vaudreuil wrote despatches home in which
he dilated at great length upon the barbarity of the
English, utterly ignoring the fact that for years past
he had sent his savages the length and breadth of the
English colonies to waste and murder at will, without
regard to either age or sex. Quebec was itself greatly
injured; many families had forsaken the city, and
taken refuge at Pointe-aux-Trembles, some eighteen
miles up the river on the north shore. Colonel
Carleton landed here with six hundred men, and took
upwards of a hundred ladies, old men, and children
prisoners. They were conducted to Wolfe’s camp, where
they were courteously treated, the ladies being invited
to dine at his table, and the following day they were
sent under escort back to Quebec.</p>

<p>The general aspect of affairs grew daily more and
more serious for English and French alike. Dysentery
and fever broke out in the English camp. On the
French side the Canadians were deserting in great
numbers, and food was becoming daily so scarce that
the rations had to be again and again reduced.
English ships prevented food arriving from Montreal
by the river, and the conveyance by land was both
slow and expensive. In Quebec there was real
suffering.</p>

<p>To add to the English troubles, General Wolfe became
so seriously ill that it was feared the end could
not be far off. He was utterly prostrate, and could
only at times rouse himself to attend to business. But
in his own mind he was maturing long-conceived plans;
and when at last an alleviation to his sufferings had
been obtained, he dictated a letter to Brigadier-Generals
Monckton, Townshend, and Murray, laying three
different plans for attacking the enemy before them.
They answered that they considered none of them
feasible, but proposed placing part of the English
army between Quebec and its means of supply, thus
forcing Montcalm either to fight or surrender. Wolfe
accepted this alternative; but he was utterly dependent
even for the power to act upon his physician.</p>

<p>“I know you cannot cure me,” he said; “but pray
make me up so that I may be without pain for a few
days, and able to do my duty. That is all I ask.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best,” answered the physician; and
he so far succeeded, that by the first days of September
Wolfe was able to mount his horse and show himself to
his men. But the difficulty still remained unsolved.
How could they land the troops so as to surprise the
French and approach Quebec? As Montcalm had said,
only by treason could it be accomplished.</p>

</h2>


<p>“If you will allow me, I will reconnoitre. Disguised
as an Indian, I can approach both the Indian and
Canadian camps. I can even penetrate into Quebec
itself. I know the language, I know their ways; I am
the man most fitted to undertake this task. Information
you must have before risking the safety of the
whole army.”</p>

<p>“He is quite right, and Captain Roger is the only
man who, with the least chance of success, can undertake
to procure us that information, without which it is
almost madness for us to attempt a landing. If he
is willing to risk his life, we shall be his debtors,” said
Colonel Howe.</p>

<p>“I am willing,” answered Roger. “With my knowledge
of Indian and Canadian warfare, I run very
little danger of being caught. You have decided, I
think, to take the fleet up the St. Lawrence, and to
effect a landing on the other side of Quebec. That
there is a footpath or a subterraneous passage somewhere
in the neighbourhood of what is called L’Anse
de Foulon I am certain. I have heard that it is a
spot much favoured by smugglers. The Jesuits had
a depôt in the neighbouring cliffs; and since then
Bigot and his crew are said to make it their hiding place.
The whole thing lies in a nutshell&#8212;to discover
the path and to assure myself to what extent it
is fortified.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” exclaimed Wolfe excitedly. “If only we
could secure a footing on the plain and force the
French to fight us!”</p>

<p>“In two days at latest if I am alive I will report to
you; if I fail in my attempt I will at least try to send
you a message,” said Roger.</p>

<p>“Of all the services you have rendered us, Captain
Roger, and they have not been a few, this will be
the greatest,” said the General, holding out his hand.
“If I could only bring this war to a close I should die
happy.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope you may live to enjoy the fruits of
your long anxiety, General,” said Roger; and he took
his leave.</p>

<p>As the door closed upon him Colonel Howe turned to
Wolfe, saying, “He’ll do it. There’s not such another
fellow in the army; and now my advice is to break up
the camp here and embark a great portion of the
troops. The French will imagine we are preparing to
sail for England.”</p>

<p>This plan was carried out, General Wolfe going on
board the <i>Sutherland</i>.</p>

<p>Admiral Holmes’ fleet, with three thousand six
hundred men on board, sailed up and down the river,
The French were thus kept night and day on the
watch to oppose their landing; and Montcalm, though
he fully believed the English were on the eve of their
departure, never for one moment relaxed his vigilance,
feeling sure Wolfe would not be satisfied to withdraw
without striking one decisive blow. So by night and
by day he was on foot, trusting no one’s supervision
save his own. He had sent three thousand men to
Bougainville, above Quebec. Captain de Vergor, with
a hundred Canadians, was posted on the heights near
the town; this spot was looked upon as perfectly safe,
being inaccessible, and was therefore considered sufficiently
protected.</p>

<p>The town of Quebec was suffering greatly from the
effects of the English fire. The handsome houses
which adorned the quay were in ruins, literally shelled
out. Many of the churches were destroyed, the cathedral
dome was laid open, and the convent and garden
of the Ursulines were torn up by the falling bombs.</p>

<p>The nuns had dispersed, some taking refuge at the
General Hospital, going sadly from their cloistered
schoolrooms and little ones to the sad hospital wards,
now filled with the wounded and dying, and where
their services were needed by night and by day.
Mercèdes with Marthe had found refuge in their old
rooms, and had taken with them Charles Langlade’s
boy. They had managed to inform the father of this,
and he had sent back word entreating them to guard
the child, as Nadjii’s father Ominipeg&#8212;the “Black
Eagle,” as he was surnamed&#8212;was seeking for him,
fearful lest he should fall a prisoner into the hands of
the English.</p>

<p>Charles himself had to feign ignorance of the child’s
whereabouts, so as not to rouse the chief’s anger at a
moment when his services were so requisite; therefore
he commended the boy to their care until such time
as he could send for or fetch him, and they accepted
the charge, and from henceforth kept him concealed,
never leaving him.</p>

<p>When Roger quitted General Wolfe’s presence, he was
determined at any risk to discover something, let it
be what it might, which would enable the English to
reach the French. He was heartily sick of the war;
the ruined homesteads, the misery he saw at home
and abroad, and the many hardships he himself had
endured, made him long for peace, almost at any price.</p>

<p>If Wolfe set sail for England it would all have to
be begun over again. The Indians, encouraged by the
French Government, would once more commit depredations
on the frontier settlements, and rapine and
ruin would ensue; and then with the spring the
war would be renewed. No, much as he might regret
the alternative, he felt that either the English must
conquer, or they must be so beaten as to allow of no
return. It was France or England.</p>

<p>There was very little difference between the Rangers’
dress and that of the Canadian scouts. The militia
had a sort of uniform, but it was never very strictly
adhered to; especially as time went on, and the difficulty
of procuring materials of any sort increased.</p>

<p>The French guarded the river banks, and it would
require great skill to land; yet that night, after sunset,
a boat ran along the coast, and when the sentries
challenged it, the answer seemed satisfactory; for it
passed on up the river towards Quebec, without apparently
attempting to avoid observation. One or two
shots were fired at it from English ships, but in the
darkness they evidently missed it, for the boat shot past
and suddenly disappeared in a sort of cove, on either
side of which high cliffs rose almost perpendicularly.</p>

<p>Roger had been absent four days. It was the evening
of the 11th of September. Autumn was settling
down over the land, to be succeeded by the bitter
Canadian winter.</p>

<p>“He’s failed, probably been killed; he’d have been
back before now if he had discovered anything,” said
Wolfe, in a voice of hopeless despair, standing on the
foredeck of the <i>Sutherland</i>. John Jervis, Earl of
St. Vincent, and George Carleton, Lord Dorchester,
the friends of his boyhood, were beside him.</p>

<p>“You have no right to speak so positively. It is
only four days since he started, and a man like Roger
is certain to have taken his precautions; he is not
likely easily to allow himself to be trapped,” said
the former; and even while he spoke a shrill whistle
fell on their ears, and, looking down, they saw a
canoe with an Indian in it lying close under the
bulwarks.</p>

<p>“It’s he!” said Lord Dorchester; and a few seconds
later Roger stood in their midst.</p>

<p>“Well, any news?” said Wolfe, coming forward.</p>

<p>“I should not be here now if I had none,” said
Roger, in a low voice; “but first let me take off these
trappings and give me some food. I have touched
nothing for twenty-four hours, and then only a crust of
bread.”</p>

<p>“Come into my cabin,” said Wolfe, and he led the
way.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the chief officers on board the
<i>Sutherland</i> were summoned to the General’s cabin.</p>

<p>Wolfe was walking up and down, two deep red spots
on his pale thin cheeks, his eyes glittering.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he said, “Captain Roger will tell you
what he has seen and heard. You will judge whether
the plan he proposes be possible; myself I tell you at
once that, notwithstanding all the apparent difficulties,
I consider it the only thing open for us to attempt;
there is a possible chance of success. Will you explain
your plan, Captain?”</p>

<p>“It is not necessary for me to tell you,” said Roger,
“how I came by the facts I am going to lay before
you, and from them to the conception of a plan which,
though desperate, is in itself simple. You saw my
disguise. I have assumed several during the last few
days, by means of which, and by my knowledge of
Indian and Canadian habits, I have managed to
approach the different camps, and at last penetrated
even into Quebec. Here, by means of bribery, I succeeded
in being introduced into Captain Vergor’s own
quarters on the heights overlooking Quebec, and can
now assure you from personal evidence that, fully
persuaded of their secure position, they are left
practically unguarded. The officer in command goes
quietly to bed, and has, moreover, weakened his guards
by allowing the Canadians to go home to their villages
to help get in their harvest.”</p>

<p>“But, taking all this for granted,” said Lord St.
Vincent, “we have still those heights to scale before we
can dislodge even so poor a watch.”</p>

<p>“I am coming to that,” said Roger. “Food is not
only lacking in Quebec, but the soldiers in camp are
absolutely without bread, or even flour. The commissariat
declared yesterday it could distribute no
further rations. You may imagine the effect of this;
but they were buoyed up with the assurance that a
number of boats are coming from Quebec to the camp
with provisions. Where these boats land, we can,” said
Roger, “and I discovered that the spot fixed upon is
the Anse de Foulon, the old smuggling cove. Last
night, disguised as an Indian, I paddled into it,
accompanied by a man I have sworn not to name. He
pointed out to me what he called a path, and then
left me in terror lest we should be surprised. The
moon was fitful, if you remember, last night; nevertheless,
it sufficed me to discover what we want. It is a
steep, precipitous ascent; half-way up trees have been
felled and laid across, forming a thick abattis; then
there is a deep gap some ten feet across and six feet
deep; after this the road widens out, and though the
ascent is steep, it is comparatively easy. I will
undertake to lead a body of men to the top to-morrow night,
if you consent. We shall take Vergor and his guard by
surprise; and when this is accomplished you can land
your troops under cover of night, and by morning you
can range them in order of battle on the heights overlooking
Quebec.”</p>

<p>“Land a whole army! It is incredible!” said Lord
St. Vincent. “Allowing that the path be unguarded,
there are sentries all along the river.”</p>

<p>“But they are expecting their own provision boats,”
said Wolfe. “If our boats go down in advance, they
may easily mistake us for them in the darkness.
Howe, will you take the lead with Captain Roger? He
will show you the way.”</p>

<p>“Certainly I will,” said Colonel Howe. “I have
implicit confidence in the Captain. Give us a score
of men, and we will see if we cannot reach the top
and dislodge a parcel of sleepy Frenchmen;” and he
laughed lightly, as if he had been proposing a pleasure
party.</p>

<p>“Then, gentlemen, that is settled; to-morrow
night we make the attempt,” said Wolfe, in a decided
voice. “Captain Roger, you had better turn in and
take a good long rest,” and he held out his hand to
Roger.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I shall be all the better for a good
sleep;” then, turning to Colonel Howe, he added,
“Unless I am very much mistaken, Colonel, you and
I shall see the sun rise over Quebec the day after
to-morrow. I am glad it should be so.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” answered the Colonel heartily, and they
shook hands.</p>

<p>“I think we are all glad,” said several voices.</p>

<p>“Even if it be the dawn of my last day on earth,
I shall greet it with thankfulness,” said Wolfe, and
the council broke up for a few hours.</p>

</h2>


<p>The following day the English vessels and boats
drifted up the river with the tide, within sight of
the French sentinels, as if they were seeking a landing
place; they had done this more or less for the last
week, so Bougainville, who was encamped on the
St. Charles, watched them without anxiety, satisfied
that they would repeat the same manœuvre on the
morrow.</p>

<p>As night drew on, Admiral Saunders, stationed opposite
Beauport, opened fire upon the French, under
cover of which the troops were embarked. Whether
due to the excitement or to the remedies administered
by his physician, Wolfe certainly for that day
seemed to have taken a new lease of life. But in
his own mind, we are told, the certainty that his
end was near never for one moment forsook him. As
he paced up and down the <i>Sutherland</i>, gazing at
the deep blue autumnal sky overhead, to those who
watched him his pale face seemed almost transfigured
by the light and fire in his eyes. A young midshipman,
John Robinson, to whom he had shown
especial kindness, standing near him, heard him slowly
recite those words which may truly be called his death
elegy, so inseparably have they become linked with his
name:&#8212;</p>

<div style='margin-left:2em;'>
“The boast of Heraldry, the pomp of Pow’r,<br/>
And all that Beauty, all that Wealth e’er gave<br/>
Await alike the inevitable hour:<br/>
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.”
</div>

<p>And, seeing that the lad was watching him, he laid
his hand on his shoulder, adding, “I had rather be the
author of that poem than take Quebec.”</p>

<p>At two o’clock on the morning of the 13th, the
signal was given for the troops to enter the boats,
and seventeen hundred men took their places in them,
and slowly drifted down the stream to their destination.</p>

<p>The French sentries placed along the shore, notwithstanding
the darkness, became aware of a more
than usual traffic on the river, and challenged them.</p>

<p>“<i>Qui vive?</i>”</p>

<p>“France,” answered Colonel Howe.</p>

<p>“Which regiment?”</p>

<p>“<i>La Reine</i>,” answered the same officer, who knew
that Bougainville commanded part of that regiment,
and so they passed on. Lower down the river they
were once more challenged. This time the answer was,
“Provision boats. Don’t make a noise, the English
will hear us.”</p>

<p>In the darkness, Captain Roger, Colonel Howe, and
twenty-four volunteers rowed up to the low sandy
beach at the foot of the crags, which seemed to rise
perpendicularly from the water’s edge.</p>

<p>The volunteers were picked men. A few of Roger’s
best Rangers were amongst them. No sentry was on
the shore; no alarm was given.</p>

<p>The order for perfect silence had been issued, and
Roger leading the way, as noiselessly as possible the
ascent was begun. Like shadows they moved up the
pathway, crawling often on their hands and knees,
the foremost removing obstacles for those who came
after, till at last they gained the top, and saw before
them the cluster of white tents. No word of command
was given. That silent group of brave men realised to
the full at that moment that victory or defeat was
in their hands, and with the impulse to conquer or to
die in the attempt, they rushed into the sleeping camp
before the slightest sound announced their presence.
Captain Vergor was in bed; he was shot, but not
mortally, and made prisoner. The same fate awaited
others, but in the darkness the greater number of the
French fled. Then there arose from the heights such
a cheer as only true-born Britons can give forth in the
hour of triumph, and it was answered from below by
men waiting breathlessly in the boats to know whether
they too might scale the long dark slope of the woody
precipice&#8212;the path to victory! General Wolfe was the
first to leap ashore, and in his excitement he struck
the earth with his sword’s point, as if claiming it
for Old England.</p>

<p>And then the ascent began, each man with his
musket slung over his shoulder. Trenches were leapt,
abattis were broken through; the stream of men came
pouring up from the boats, which, as soon as they
were emptied, rowed back to the ships and brought
more, until all the troops were landed.</p>

<p>The day was hardly dawning when Wolfe stood
with the advanced troops on the heights. Anxiously,
with penetrating eyes, he gazed in the direction
from whence he supposed the French would come.
At the expiration of an hour, when almost all the
English troops had reached the summit, a cloud of
dust, like smoke, with flashes of light, was seen on
the horizon.</p>

<p>“The French!” said Wolfe calmly, pointing to the
long line growing ever more and more distinct in the
increasing morning light. On an open tract of grass,
interspersed with cornfields, having on one side the
St. Lawrence, and sloping down on the other to the
St. Charles, General Wolfe and his officers stationed
the English army, numbering in all three thousand
five hundred men; and there, on the ever-celebrated
Plains of Abraham, they awaited their adversaries.</p>

<p>Montcalm, when first informed of the landing of the
English, exclaimed,&#8212;</p>

<p>“It can be but a small party come to burn a few
houses and retire.”</p>

<p>He sent at once to Vaudreuil, who was quartered
near Quebec, but receiving no answer, at six o’clock he
mounted, and, accompanied by Langlade and Johnstone,
rode towards the town. As he crossed the St. Charles,
he saw on the heights above Quebec the long red line
of the English army calmly awaiting him. He knew
now that it must be fought out. He turned his
horse’s head to the Governor’s quarters; a short and
sharp altercation ensued, and then Montcalm, joining
his army, rode towards the battle-field, where already
the battalion of Guienne had taken up its position.
The white-and-blue uniforms of the regular French
army, flanked by the sombre-clad Canadians, were
clearly visible; whilst the Indians in their war-paint,
with their waving plumes and steel hatchets, were
stationed some twenty paces in advance, with orders
to throw themselves into the first breach made in the
English ranks by the French balls.</p>

<p>To the sound of the drums the five battalions of
Grenadiers, in their long black gaiters, marched to the
front. Arrived within forty paces of the English, they
halted, and the two armies, face to face with each
other, waited in solemn, silent hesitation. Old enemies
on a new soil, on how many a European battle-field
had their forefathers fought for dominion! And now
they waited, awed, on this virgin soil, who should
begin this mortal duel.</p>

<p>In a clear voice the word of command flew along
the English line. A sound as of thunder broke forth,
rolling along, to be repeated in continuous roar; and
as the smoke cleared off, in the French ranks there
were deep gaps, as if a scythe had passed through
cutting them down. The battle was begun.</p>

<p>Another volley, and yet another. The militia, which
was interspersed with the regular French troops, unable
any longer to stand the fire, hesitated. Montcalm
saw it.</p>

<p>“Forward, forward!” he cried, showing with the
point of his sword the English ranks still unmoved.
At the same moment a ball struck him.</p>

<div id='i001' class='mt01 mb01 i001'>
  <img src='images/illus-001.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
</div>

<p>“You are wounded, General,” said an officer beside
him.</p>

<p>“It is of no account, sir. Ride forward and rally the
Canadians; they are retreating.” Himself he sprang
forward into their midst.</p>

<p>“Courage, my children, courage!” he cried; but
another ball struck him, and his white uniform was
stained with blood.</p>

<p>“Support me; do not let them see me fall,” he
murmured, striving with a superhuman will to keep
himself erect.</p>

<p>At that moment Wolfe gave the order to charge, and
the wild yell of the Highlanders, mingled with the
British cheer, rose loud and fierce.</p>

<p>A shot shattered Wolfe’s wrist; he wrapped his handkerchief
round it and went on. A second shot struck
him; he still advanced. A third pierced his breast; he
staggered and fell. Then the officers surrounding him
carried him to the rear.</p>

<p>“Send for a surgeon,” said Lord St. Vincent.</p>

<p>“There is no need; it is all over with me,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“They run; see how they run!” cried some
one.</p>

<p>“Who run?” asked Wolfe, with a sudden return to
life.</p>

<p>“The enemy, sir; they give way everywhere.”</p>

<p>“Tell Colonel Burton to cut off their retreat from
the bridge,” he said; and turning on his side, he added,
“Now, God be praised, I will die in peace.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later, for him the battle of life was
over.</p>

<p>But to his country he left a rich heritage, with
which his name is ever linked in high honour. Canada
became then and is now one of the brightest jewels of
the British Empire. She was bought with the price
of many a young and noble life, but, ever loyal and true
to England and her sovereigns, she has proved herself
worthy of the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Canada has, moreover, taught the world the lesson
that two peoples, supposed to be antagonistic, can live
together in perfect peace and harmony, side by side
in the same cities, each speaking their own language
and retaining their own customs. The wisdom and
conciliatory policy of the British Government effected
this union, which has been pacifically maintained ever
since. The French population, which far outnumbered
the English, finding themselves treated with justice,
and, instead of being driven forth, encouraged to remain
in the land, assured of religious freedom and the equity
of the laws, willingly submitted to the new rule, and
have proved as faithful subjects as their English
brethren.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXX</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.1em'>THE VANQUISHED</span>
</h2>


<p>The Indians had fought bravely. Charles Langlade
and their chief Ominipeg had kept them steady.
Long after the Canadians were in full retreat they lay
behind a mound firing without ceasing on the English,
who were advancing upon them. Then a strange thing
happened.</p>

<p>Ominipeg stood on a grassy knoll, on the left side of
which were high bushes, and looked around upon the
battle-field. He knew that Montcalm was wounded;
he saw the Canadians flying before the English: the
cause was lost; he and his tribe would ere long be
prisoners.</p>

<p>The Black Eagle could not brook defeat. Charles
Langlade, lying on the ground at a little distance firing
on the English, saw him suddenly stoop behind the
bushes and gather something in his arms. A cry, a
child’s cry, even through the din of battle reached his
ears, and a terrified baby face, round which the soft
fair curls clustered, appeared before his agonised gaze.
To spring forward to seize him would have been the
work of a second, but Ominipeg was too quick for him.
Clasping the child tightly in his arms, with horrible
cries, brandishing his enormous battle-axe, the Indian
chief, followed by his whole tribe, dashed into the
midst of the enemy.</p>

<p>The yells and war-whoops of the savages gradually
died out as the English bayonets pierced their naked
bodies, and they lay upon the ground a bleeding mass
of humanity. They had fulfilled their code of honour;
they had died for the cause they could not save!</p>

<p>And the Black Eagle, with his daughter’s child, the
little “White Chief,” as he had been surnamed, lay
foremost among the slain. A shot had struck Charles
Langlade to the ground before he could advance a step
to save the child.</p>

<p>That morning, at early dawn, when the first alarm
had reached Quebec, a young Indian had passed
rapidly through the streets, gained the house inhabited
by Mercèdes, and knocked loudly at the door of her
apartment.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” asked Marthe.</p>

<p>“Langlade; open quickly,” was the answer. She
hastened to obey; the Indian glided into the room,
looked round, and saw the child sleeping in its little bed.
To snatch it in his arms, smothering its cries, and disappear
with it, was the work of a second.</p>

<p>Roused by the noise, Mercèdes came running in,
but the child was gone. Marthe was wringing her
hands, and in short, incoherent phrases told Mercèdes
what had happened.</p>

<p>But events were to succeed each other so rapidly that
they had hardly time to breathe, much more think.
So accustomed had they become to the bombardment
of the city that, though it sounded more continuous
and louder than usual that morning, they attached no
especial importance to it; but a nun with a white,
terrified face came to them from the Superior, bidding
them repair at once to the General Hospital, that the
English were on the Heights of Abraham, and that
a great battle was being fought. Wrapping their
black cloaks around them, and drawing their hoods
over their heads in such a way as to conceal their
faces, they hastened to obey, passing quickly through
the streets, in some parts crowded by frightened
citizens driven forth from their half-ruined houses, in
others swept clean by the bombs which came whizzing
down from the English batteries. Very white and fixed
was the young novice’s face as she glided along. She
suddenly came to a standstill, almost in front of the
Church of the Ursulines, where a crowd was gathered,
which opened to let a party of soldiers, carrying a
litter which had been hastily constructed out of guns
crossed one over the other, pass on their way.</p>

<p>The brilliant rays of the sun fell full upon the livid
face of the man who lay thereon. The waxen features
were thrown into relief by the black military cloak
around him.</p>

<p>Not a cry escaped Mercèdes’ lips, though in that second
she had had time enough to recognise her father; but
like an arrow she flew to his side. One of the officers
knew her, and gently and pityingly made way for her,
and she entered the church with the litter; then the
heavy doors were closed to keep back the surging crowd.
Slowly, with measured steps, surrounded by his officers,
they bore him up the nave; in front of the high
altar the soldiers laid down their precious burden, and
Mercèdes, kneeling beside him, raised his hand to her
lips. He made no sign of being even aware of her
presence; his eyes were fixed, his features immovable;
his soul was still on the battle-field in the agony of
that first moment of defeat. A surgeon had been
hastily summoned, who examined the patient and
probed the wound; but not a muscle of Montcalm’s face
moved even under that agony. When it was over, and
a temporary dressing had been applied, he said, “Well,
sir, how long have I to live?”</p>

<p>“General,” answered the surgeon, in a low, pained
voice, “a few hours only.”</p>

<p>“All the better,” he said. “I shall not see the
English enter Quebec,” and he closed his eyes. Notwithstanding
the wounds received on the battle-field,
borne by the tide of the fugitives the General had
ridden into Quebec at the head of the army, crossed
the bridge under the northern rampart, and entered
the palace gate. At that moment another shot reached
him, which, passing through his body, proved fatal,
and he was half lifted, half fell from his horse; and
so it came to pass that his soldiers bore him into the
Church of the Ursulines.</p>

<p>Mercèdes and Marthe tended him. Quiet and loving
were the words which from time to time he spoke to
them. A few only of those who surrounded them knew
that the pale-faced novice was his daughter. Michel,
the gardener of the Ursuline Convent, fetched and
carried for them, and so that fatal day drew to an end.</p>

<p>Towards evening, Ramsay, the new Governor, came
and asked Montcalm’s advice as to how he might best
defend Quebec.</p>

<p>“Have you any orders to give me, General?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Sir,” answered Montcalm, “I deliver into your
hands the honour of France. I shall spend my night
with God preparing to die.”</p>

<p>Then he asked for pen and paper, and desired one
of his officers to write at his dictation:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class='sc'>General</span>,&#8212;The humanity of the English sets my
mind at peace concerning the fate of the French
prisoners and the Canadians.</p>

<p>“May you feel towards them as they have caused
me to feel for them. Do not let them feel that they
have changed masters. Be their protector, as I have
been their father.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“Let this letter be sent without delay to General
Wolfe,” he said, when with difficulty he had succeeded
in signing it.</p>

<p>“It is rumoured that James Wolfe is either dead or
dying,” replied one of his officers.</p>

<p>“He also!” said Montcalm. “At least he is happier
than I am,” he added; “he dies in the midst of his
country’s triumph.”</p>

<p>Shortly after this his face became livid. His sufferings
were intense; he could only from time to time
give utterance to a few words in a low voice to
Mercèdes, tender remembrances for the loved ones at
home! About midnight the Bishop Pont Briand administered
the last Sacraments of the Church in which
he had lived and was now dying.</p>

<p>Gently, almost painlessly, he lingered until the dawn
of a new day, and as the light began to creep into the
sacred building his eyes closed. When the surgeon,
who had never left him, saw the eyelids droop, he
shook his head sadly, slipped his hand under the white
uniform so deeply stained with blood, and waited a few
minutes, then he rose.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he said, turning to the group of
officers who stood watching, “that great heart has
ceased to beat.”</p>

<p>Mercèdes never moved, her head was bowed low on
her father’s bier; Marthe alone wept, kneeling there
beside her master.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the doors of the church were thrown
open, and the crowd which had been waiting patiently
outside came flocking up the nave. Soldiers of that
poor defeated army, inhabitants of Quebec, Canadians,
savages, pressed around to take a last look at the
brave General who had so gallantly defended them.
In the dim morning light the torches flared, showing
the half-ruined church, the roof laid open, through
which the sky looked down, shattered pillars, the
pavement torn up by bombs which in bursting had
made deep holes; and in the centre of all this ruin,
surrounded by his officers, lay that still figure wrapped
in his black mantle, looking grander in death than he
had done in life.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the same day they carried him
into the forsaken garden of the Convent of the Ursulines.
The bursting of a shell dug his grave, and
there they laid him, all who had known and loved him
grieving, not for the hero so much as for the man.</p>

<p>Throughout that night two women knelt and prayed
beside that lonely grave.</p>

</h2>


<p>“No news of the lads yet, Martha! Will they never
come home?” said Nathaniel impatiently, as he
sat in the wide porch of Alpha Marsh one bright
autumn day.</p>

<p>“No, there be no news,” answered Martha sadly;
“and yet they say the fighting’s over for the present.
I’m minded, if they’ve not both been killed, they’ll be
here before long.”</p>

<p>“Both killed! Our bonnie lads, Martha? Nay,
I cannot think God would have spared my life and
taken them. I’m not of much account now,” and he
looked at his arm, which hung helpless in his coatsleeve.</p>

<p>“You’ve no need to fret; you’re wonderfully better,”
said Martha. “And as for the lads, it isn’t likely they’re
together; they’ll be dropping in when we least expect
them, one after the other.”</p>

<p>“God grant it,” said Nat; “but somehow I always
see them together;” and he rose from his chair, and
went and stood by the wicket gate, looking down the
road which skirted the forest and led to the village.</p>

<p>During the year which had elapsed since the Indians
invaded Marshwood, it had gradually resumed its
former appearance of happy prosperity. Most of the
houses destroyed by the fire had been rebuilt; a fresh
harvest had been gathered in; and if some hearts
still ached for those who had fallen, time was gradually
softening the horrors of that terrible night, and casting
a halo over the memory of the lost.</p>

<p>Early the previous spring Martha Langlade had
returned to Alpha Marsh, bringing little Susie with
her, though in truth she was “little Susie” no longer,
but a tall fine girl, very proud of her knowledge of city
life, and only desirous of returning to Boston, where
they had left Marie, the happy bride of young William
Parkmann.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Boscowen had to a great extent recovered
his health; his arm alone was still powerless; but as
time went on his restless longing for the return of the
“lads,” as he called them, grew painfully intense. The
news of the fall of Quebec, and of both Montcalm’s and
Wolfe’s death, had reached him in due time, and from
that hour he had, so to speak, waited by night and by
day.</p>

<p>“They’ll be here to-morrow,” he would say, with
a sigh, when Loïs bade him “Good-night”; and she
would answer with a smile which grew every day
fainter,&#8212;</p>

<p>“Yes, Father Nat; they’ll be here to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Several companies of Rangers had returned to their
homes, bringing the assurance that Roger was alive,
that they had seen him after the battle; but of
Charles there was no news, and Loïs, like Nathaniel,
waited, going patiently about her daily work, with that
look of hungry longing which grows in women’s eyes
from “hope deferred.”</p>

<p>Between her and Roger there had been no words
of reconciliation, but, beside Nadjii’s grave, when they
laid her to rest under the shadow of the great oak
tree in the home meadow, and in the long night
watches by Father Nat’s bedside, the hardness had
melted out of Roger’s face; their hands had touched,
their eyes had looked into each other’s; once more
it was “Loïs” and “Roger.” And so, through all
the months of sadness and loneliness after he left
them, Loïs bore up bravely, for hope, blessed hope, was
hers.</p>

<p>She worked as she had never done before, comforting
the widows and clothing and feeding the orphan
children. Love gave her strength as only love can.
Through the bright short spring and long summer
days she waited, with the never-ceasing prayer upon
her lips for “Peace, blessed peace.” But now for
many weeks she had had no news, save what the stray
home-comers had brought; and yet the war was over&#8212;the
English were masters of Quebec. Why then did
Roger linger?</p>

<p>Of late the habit had come to her of going to the
upper windows and looking out over the country.
Vague rumours of Charles’ death had reached both
her and Marcus, but by common consent they hid
it from Martha and Father Nat, who always repeated,
“The two will come together. Many things may
have happened to detain them on the road,” and both
she and Marcus were thankful he should think thus.
But the winter was fast approaching, and then the
land would be icebound, and long dreary months must
elapse before they could hope to see the wanderers.
Oh, how earnestly Loïs prayed for news, only for news,
of them, and it came to pass that her prayer was
granted. But alas, how?</p>

<p>Loïs was always up betimes. All the dairy work fell
to her lot, and Martha had been ailing lately, fretting
for Charles, they all knew. As she stood in the dairy,
pouring the new milk, which the maids had just
brought in, from the pails into the earthen pans for
setting, the old Indian woman Nokomis crept up to
her with a mysterious look on her face.</p>

<p>“Well, Nokomis, what has happened? Have you
burnt the cakes for breakfast?” asked Loïs.</p>

<p>She shook her grisly head and answered slowly,
“Alas, alas, mistress! there be those who will never
eat of my cakes again, and yet he loved them! Old
Nokomis’ cakes&#8212;he’d take them half-baked out of the
oven, for the smell of them!”</p>

<p>“Who are you speaking of?” said Loïs, hastily
putting down the half-empty pail.</p>

<p>“Who should I speak of if not of the young
master? Ah, it was an evil day when Boscowen
and Langlade parted; they’ll never come together
again.”</p>

<p>“What have you heard?” said Loïs, turning deadly
pale.</p>

<p>“The boy’s there; he can speak,” said Nokomis.</p>

<p>“What boy?” asked Loïs. “Oh, Nokomis, if there
be news of Roger and Charles, do not keep me waiting.”</p>

<p>Thus adjured, the Indian woman went to the door,
made a sign to some one, and in another minute an
Indian youth entered and stood before Loïs.</p>

<p>“What have you to tell me?” she asked tremulously.</p>

<p>The boy answered,&#8212;</p>

<p>“I am Nadjii’s brother. I carried the boy away,
but the White Chief, his father, found him, and
would have hidden him from Ominipeg, but he could
not; the ‘Black Eagle’ took him, and carried him
into the battle, and they were killed together. And
last of all the White Chief was killed; I saw him
fall. They are all gone into the land of the Great
Spirit.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say my brother is dead?” said
Loïs, leaning against the wall to keep herself from
falling.</p>

<p>“Yes, I mean it; they are all dead, and I will stay
here and serve you. I loved the White Chief, and
I served him. He told me many things. I will live
with the white man, and pray to the Great Spirit
Jesus”; and suiting the action to the word, he sat
down upon the floor, in token that he meant to abide
there.</p>

<p>Silence, a dead silence, fell upon them. The early
morning light came creeping in through the windows,
a pale autumn light with no warmth or brightness in
it. A chill feeling of despair overpowered Loïs; she
looked at the dark messenger. Could he be speaking
the truth? Might he not be mistaken? But she knew
the Indian lad; he had often brought her messages
from Charles, even when he was a mere child; now
he was about fifteen, and there was no reason why he
should deceive her. What should she do with him?
If she took him into the kitchen the rest of the family
would see him, and the news he brought would spread
from mouth to mouth, until it reached the ears of her
mother and Father Nat. At present this must be
avoided.</p>

<p>“How have you travelled?” she asked. “And how
long have you been on the road?”</p>

<p>“I travelled the same way as the hunters, through
the forests. I have come often before; I know the
way,” said the boy. “The moon was new when I
started; it is full now.”</p>

<p>“You must be tired; you had better rest. Nokomis,
take him to the attic next yours in Omega Marsh,
and be careful that neither my mother nor Father
Nat sees him, until I tell you. Give him bread and
meat, and all he needs. You will keep quiet for a
day or two, until I know what to do,” she said to the
boy.</p>

<p>Her eyes were full of tears, her lips trembled; she
never for one moment doubted the truth of the story
he told. Her brother was dead, the child was dead,
and Roger&#8212;where was he?</p>

<p>Nokomis signed to the Indian to follow her, and
skirting the outhouses, they reached the back entrance
to Omega Marsh, which was at present only
inhabited by herself and one or two men, Father
Nat having remained since his illness at Alpha
Marsh.</p>

<p>“You lie quiet here. Nokomis bring you food: you
sleep; no work.” And to this pleasant prospect the
Indian readily acquiesced. Nevertheless Nokomis,
when she left him, took the precaution of turning
the key and putting it in her pocket.</p>

<p>Two days later, when she went in the early morning
to take him his food, he was gone; the dormer
window was open, and, looking out, she knew he had
escaped by the roof. Here and there a creeper had
been loosened, and in the grass and on the ground
below she saw traces of feet&#8212;not the Indian’s naked
feet only, but the print of a woman’s shoe; and she
stood and looked, then went across to Alpha Marsh,
her eyes fixed on the ground, like a dog on the
scent. As she passed Bob’s kennel she saw it was
empty.</p>

<p>“Bob, Bob!” she called. There was no answer.
“He gone too,” she muttered between her teeth.
Taking the key of the back kitchen from the hiding place
where she put it every night, she entered,
looked round, went into the pantry, examined the
safe in which cold meats and other provisions were
kept, lifted the cover of the bread-bin, and counted
the loaves. While she was thus occupied Marcus
entered.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Nokomis?” he asked, watching
her curiously for a few seconds.</p>

<p>“Where’s Loïs?” she asked, looking up at
him.</p>

<p>“Not yet up, I suppose,” he answered. “She’s overslept
herself&#8212;an unusual thing for her.”</p>

<p>“You go and look in her room. I tell you she’s
gone.”</p>

<p>“Gone! Where should she be gone?” said
Marcus.</p>

<p>“To bring the lads home,” said Nokomis; and then
for the first time Marcus heard of the arrival of the
Indian lad, the story he related, and how he had
disappeared.</p>

<p>“Why did she not tell me?” he thought bitterly;
and yet his faith in Loïs was so great that he checked
the angry feeling, and went straight up to her room.
There he found the confirmation of Nokomis’ words.
The bed had not been slept in; Loïs was gone! But
surely not without a word! No, there on the table
was a letter addressed to himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<span class='sc'>Dear Marcus</span>,&#8212;Forgive me,” she wrote. “For the
last two days and nights I have prayed unceasingly for
God to guide me, and it has been borne in upon me
that, notwithstanding all the Indian lad tells me,
Charles and the child are still living. At first I did not
think so; but now I do. I know where Charles put
the child&#8212;in the Convent of the Ursulines at Quebec;
I am going there. Tell Father Nat and the mother
that I have had news of Charles; that he needs me,
therefore I am gone to him. They shall hear soon;
but do not let them know the rumour of his death.
Why should they grieve, perhaps without a cause? I
have taken money, my Indian guide, and Bob. Have
no fear for me; God and His angels will guide my
steps. I am going forth in His strength, without fear,
to bring our dear ones home. Pray for me, and tell
John Cleveland to pray for me in the congregation
on the Sabbath Day, until I come back to you all, and
we settle down in peace. I go without warning you;
not from mistrust, but because I know you would wish
to go in my stead, and that must not be. You are all
that is left to us. If harm befell you, the Marshes
would indeed be without a master and desolate. I am
only a woman!</p>

<div style='text-align:right; margin-right:4em;'>“Your loving sister,</div>
<div style='text-align:right'>“<span class='sc'>Loïs</span>.”</div>

</blockquote>

<p>“And truly a brave one!” said John Cleveland,
when he had read the letter, which Marcus took
straight down to the minister’s house. “You can but
do as she says; tell Father Nat she has been sent for,
and is gone on the road to meet Charles. You may
be sure she’ll manage to send us news before many
days are over; we’ll just live from day to day in hope
and prayer. If any one can bring the lads home,
Loïs can. Go about your work as usual, Marcus; tell
Nokomis to keep a silent tongue in her head. I’ll
come up and see your mother and Father Nat. No
need to say she’s gone to Quebec: we don’t know
whether she’ll ever get there; maybe she’ll meet them
on the road.”</p>

<p>Marcus shook his head.</p>

<p>“I do not think there is much chance of that,” he
said.</p>

<p>“How dare you say so?” said John Cleveland
sharply; “and you who would be a minister and teach
others. With God nothing is impossible. Have faith,
lad&#8212;faith which can remove mountains,” and he
clapped him on the shoulder, adding, “And now I’ll
just let my missis know I’m going to breakfast up at the
Marshes. I won’t leave you to face Father Nat alone.
How he’ll live the day through without Loïs, his right
hand, is more than I can tell. She thinks she’s of no
account because she’s a woman, but we men should be
badly off without our womankind, even though there
are not many like our Loïs. I only want to live long
enough to give her and Roger my blessing on their
wedding-day, and I believe I shall, and that before
long.”</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to hoodwink Father Nat. But
she was gone; there was no remedy: they could not
go after her, not knowing which way she had taken;
and so, when Martha wept and wailed “that all
her children were going from her,” Nathaniel said
quietly,&#8212;</p>

<p>“She’s a wise and a good lass, and the Lord is with
her. No harm will come to her, and maybe she’ll bring
both the lads back.”</p>

<p>And so they watched and waited at the Marshes,
and the snow fell covering the earth, and the rivers
were icebound, and still there was no news of the
wanderers.</p>

<h2 id='chXXXII' title='XXXII—ON THE BATTLE-FIELD'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXXII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.1em'>ON THE BATTLE-FIELD</span>
</h2>


<p>The silver light of the moon was shining down on the
battle-field, where the dead and dying lay in hideous
confusion, the night after the fray. Dark figures
moved stealthily to and fro, lanterns flashed on ghastly
upturned faces, piteous voices called for help, hands
were stretched out praying for mercy, too often only
to meet death and spoliation. Birds of prey hovered
overhead. Alas for poor human nature! there were
those abroad who reverenced neither heroism nor death,
but laid rude hands on their fellow-men, robbing and
mutilating the prostrate forms as they lay writhing in
death’s agony.</p>

<p>A group of half a dozen men in the well-known dress
of the Royal Rangers had found their way to that part
of the battle-field where the Indians had made their
last fierce onslaught. The near approach of death had
not extinguished the passionate instincts of hatred and
revenge; more than once the treacherous knife gleamed
in a dying hand seeking still to slay. Every precaution
had to be taken by the searchers, as they picked their
way over the ground strewn so thickly with the dead
and dying, to avoid the murderous thrusts.</p>

<p>“Look here, Captain!” and the speaker, a young
man, pointed to where a red chief lay, with a little
child clasped in his arms. A shot had pierced the baby
heart, in kindly mercy quieting for ever its wild
fluttering; but the blue eyes were wide open still, and
retained that look of terror mirrored in them which
gleamed there when death came, and the long fair
curls were dabbled in blood.</p>

<p>The man who had been addressed as Captain stood
looking down upon the group. Pain, bitter pain, was
visible in every line of his face. “It is Ominipeg,”
he said, and stooping, he lifted the dead child in his
arms and wrapped it in his bearskin. He and his
companions knew enough of Indian customs to understand
how that infant came by his death&#8212;a chief’s son
in the foremost ranks of the slain!</p>

<p>They renewed their search; and, at last, amidst
those dark naked figures, with their wild headgear
and strange fantastic war-paint, they found him they
sought. He was lying propped up against a tree;
evidently, when the battle was over, he had dragged
himself thither. Was he dead? Roger bent eagerly
over him, and took the hand which hung listlessly by
his side.</p>

<p>“Charles,” he said; and the strong man’s voice
trembled.</p>

<p>“Roger, am I dreaming, or have you come to take
me home?”</p>

<p>The drooping head is raised, and the cold fingers
close over Roger’s.</p>

<p>“We will go home together,” he said. “Are you
much hurt, Charles?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” he answered dreamily. “Is the
battle over? Are we beaten?”</p>

<p>“The battle is ended,” said Roger; “and God grant
it may be our last,” and he signed to his men that the
search was finished, that their help was needed. They
lifted the wounded man in their arms and slowly bore
him off the battle-field to where in the moonlight
clustered the white tents of the Rangers, and there
they laid him down.</p>

<p>Quebec had capitulated, notwithstanding Levis’ rapid
march to its relief. Ramsay paid but little attention to
Montcalm’s last words, and, encouraged by Vaudreuil,
on the 18th surrendered to the English. Honourable
terms were granted. The garrison was to march out
with the honours of war, and the troops be carried
back to France on English ships; the inhabitants to
have protection in person and property, free exercise
of their religion, and all other privileges of British
subjects. These conditions having been formally agreed
to and signed, the British flag was raised on the heights
near Mount Street, and General Murray was named
Governor of Quebec.</p>

<p>As soon as he could do so, Roger had brought Charles
into the city. He was unconscious at the time, and
the military surgeon gave but faint hope of his recovery.
It was a battle between life and death, but youth and a
strong constitution aiding, Roger was at last rewarded
by seeing Charles enter upon what might be called
convalescence; but by that time winter had set in,
and there was no possibility of communicating with
Marshwood. “I ought to have thought of sending a
messenger immediately after the battle,” Roger said;
“but I didn’t know quite what you meant to do, so
I waited, and now it is too late.” So time passed on.</p>

<p>One evening, a lady, deeply veiled, came to the
house where the two friends lodged, and, asking to
see Mr. Langlade, was admitted.</p>

<p>Charles was seated in an armchair near the large
open fireplace; he turned as the stranger entered, and,
when she raised her veil, exclaimed, “Madame Péan!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, coming forward; “I heard you were
in Quebec, where I myself have been detained by
severe illness, and I have come to you with a message
from Mercèdes Montcalm.”</p>

<p>“She is well, I trust?” said Charles, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, she is,” answered Madame Péan, “and the
day after to-morrow she takes the veil. I have done
the best I could to dissuade her, offering to take her
back with me to France in the spring, but she will
not listen to me; her place, she says, is by her father’s
grave, in the convent garden, and the Bishop and
Mother Superior have consented to shorten her
novitiate. One thing troubles her, the loss of the
child committed to her care by you. When I heard you
were in Quebec I told her, and she entreated me to
come to you without delay, to hear what had become
of the child.”</p>

<p>“He is dead,” said Charles; “his mother’s tribe
stole him, lest he should be made a prisoner, and he
was killed. Tell her this, or not, as you deem best.”</p>

<p>“If you will, you can tell her yourself,” said Madame.
“She bids farewell to her friends to-night; if you come
to the convent, you can have speech with her for the
last time.”</p>

<p>“I will come,” said Charles, his pale face flushing.</p>

<p>“She thought you would,” said Madame; “she has
not many friends to whom to bid farewell, and the
General loved you.”</p>

<p>“Not better than I loved him,” said Charles, rousing
himself. “Tell Mademoiselle Mercèdes I will be at
the convent to-night after vespers; and thank you a
thousand times for coming to me. I would not have
missed seeing her once more, for all the world,” and
he held out his hand to Madame Péan.</p>

<p>“I guessed as much,” she answered. Their eyes
met, and she slowly shook her head. “It is too late,”
she said; “all that was earthly in her heart and soul
has dropped away from her and lies buried in her
father’s grave. She has no thoughts left which are not
of heaven. And now I will leave you. As soon as to-morrow’s
ceremony is over I go to Montreal. Is there
any service I can render you? any request you have
to make to Chevalier Levis? He is well aware how you
have behaved throughout the war, and would be only
too glad if you would join his poor remnant of an
army, with which he still hopes to wrest Canada from
the English.”</p>

<p>Charles shook his head.</p>

<p>“He will never do that,” he said. “The cause is lost;
he will only uselessly sacrifice fresh lives. Is it not
so, Roger?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly it is. But, Madame,” said Roger,
“if you would do my friend a real service, it would be
to obtain from the Chevalier for him and for me a free
pass through all the country still occupied by the
French troops. We are anxious to return to our people,
but without this it would be almost impossible during
the winter; we should have to take such a circuitous
route, and my friend’s health is not sufficiently recovered
to resist the cold and fatigue; if we can pass through
Montreal, it will shorten the journey greatly.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best,” said Madame Péan. “And now
farewell; we are none of us likely to meet again in this
world. When the last French ship leaves the shores
of Canada, I shall sail in her, and go back to old
France.” She dropped her veil and rose. Charles also
rose, and silently they shook hands; then Roger re-conducted
her to her carriage, and they took leave of
each other.</p>

<p>She had said truly they were never to meet again.</p>

<p>That evening, as he had promised, Charles went alone
to the convent. He waited what seemed to him an
eternity in the parlour, watching anxiously a grated
window in the wall, across which was a dark curtain;
at last he saw it slowly drawn back, and on the
opposite side, with a face almost as white as her veil,
stood Mercèdes.</p>

<p>“Thank you for coming,” she said, in a low, calm
voice. “Before bidding my last farewell to the world,
I desired greatly to see you, to tell you how I have
grieved for the child you committed to my care. I
loved him very dearly. I would not have parted from
him if I could possibly have done otherwise; but we
were taken by surprise. Before even Marthe, who was
in the room with him, was aware of it, he was gone; we
had no time to prevent it; he was truly spirited away.
I pray you forgive me: it has been a bitter grief to me.”</p>

<p>“Forgive you!” exclaimed Charles. “Surely you
never for one moment thought I blamed either you or
Marthe? Knowing the Indians would use every means
in their power to get hold of my poor little son, I
placed him with you, believing he must be safe in the
convent. How could either of us imagine you would
be driven out into the world again? How can I harbour
one thought of blame against you! Indeed, I almost
think it best for him to be at rest. Had he lived, his
would have been a very divided life. He must have
suffered, and I for him. I am content. It is well with
the child.”</p>

<p>“I am thankful to hear you speak thus,” answered
Mercèdes. “Truly all God does is well done. And now,
Monsieur Langlade, I will bid you farewell. You will
go back to the world to which, to-morrow, I shall for
ever bid adieu; but I wish to thank you for many
pleasant hours and for much kindness, but, above all
things, for your faithfulness to my dear father. I beg
you to cherish his memory, and be assured I shall ever
remember you in my prayers.”</p>

<p>“No one who has ever lived with General Montcalm
as I have can possibly forget him. I shall cherish his
memory as long as I live,” said Charles, with deep
emotion.</p>

<p>“Thanks, I am glad to think it will be so,” and a
faint smile lighted up her pale face. “Adieu!” and she
passed her hand between the iron bars. “Wear this
in remembrance of him,” she added, slipping a ring of
great price on his finger.</p>

<p>“I will never part with it. Adieu,” repeated Charles,
and stooping, he touched the tips of her fingers with his
lips. When he raised his head she had disappeared.</p>

<p>The following morning he was amongst the spectators
who witnessed the ceremony of Mercèdes Montcalm
taking the veil, and as he left the chapel his heart was
very sad within him.</p>

<h2 id='chXXXIII' title='XXXIII—A LONG JOURNEY'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXXIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.1em'>A LONG JOURNEY</span>
</h2>

<p>“Reverend Mother, there is a woman at the gate
with an Indian lad and a big dog. She is asking
to speak with one ‘Mercèdes Montcalm,’” said old
Michel, the gardener and doorkeeper of the convent.</p>

<p>“It is late, Michel; we cannot let strangers in at
this hour. Tell her she must return to-morrow,” said
the Reverend Mother of the Ursulines.</p>

<p>“I told her as much,” said Michel; “but she bade
me say she had travelled from the far west, that she
was very weary, and knew not where to go. She gave
me this,” and he handed her a slip of paper.</p>

<p>“I am Loïs Langlade, Charles Langlade’s sister, and
am come to fetch the child my brother gave in charge
to Mercèdes Montcalm.”</p>

<p>“Poor thing!” said the Mother; “she does not
know. This will grieve our new sister, Marie Mercèdes;
but you must bring the stranger in, Michel. Charles
Langlade’s sister cannot remain in the streets.”</p>

<p>“And the Indian and the dog?” said Michel.</p>

<p>“Keep them at the lodge,” said the Reverend
Mother. The man went out. The Mother rang a
small bell beside her, which was answered by a serving
sister.</p>

<p>“Go to Sister Marie Mercèdes’ cell, and tell her to
come here without delay,” she said. As the sister
went out, a tall figure wrapped in a thick cloak with a
hood drawn over her head entered, and with her a large
wolf-hound, which she held by its collar.</p>

<p>“It was no use, Reverend Mother; he would have
torn me to pieces rather than leave her,” said
Michel.</p>

<p>“He knows I have only him to protect me,” said
a gentle voice. “Indeed, he is quite harmless as long
as no one lays hands on me. Lie down, Bob,” and,
obedient to her word, the animal stretched himself at
her feet.</p>

<p>“My child,” said the Reverend Mother, “you have
asked to see Mercèdes Montcalm. She bade adieu
to the world this morning; she is dead to all things
earthly.”</p>

<p>“Dead,” repeated Loïs slowly; “it seems to me that
every one is dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead to the world, I said,” continued the Superior.
“There is no Mercèdes Montcalm, only Sister Marie
Mercèdes. What do you want with her, my child?
You look very weary; sit down,” and she pointed to a
chair.</p>

<p>“I have come many hundred miles,” said Loïs,
“in search of my brother and my brother’s child. He
sent me word that he had placed the boy here with
Mercèdes Montcalm.”</p>

<p>“So he did,” answered the Reverend Mother.</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened, and Loïs saw the
small, darkly-clad figure of a young nun enter. The
face was very pale; the eyes had a strained look in
them, and were bright as if with fever.</p>

<p>“Come hither, my daughter,” said the Reverend
Mother. “I grieve to have disturbed you at your
devotions, but here is one who has come from afar to
fetch Charles Langlade’s little child. Will you tell
her what you know concerning it, so that she may be
satisfied?”</p>

<p>“Are you Loïs Langlade?” said Sister Marie, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Loïs; “tell me, where is the child?”</p>

<p>“Why have you come to me instead of going to
your brother? He would have told you, and spared me
the pain. Forgive me, Reverend Mother; it is still
pain,” said Sister Marie, bowing her head.</p>

<p>“My brother!” said Loïs, rising quickly, and with
such a ring of joy in her voice,&#8212;“he is alive then,
and you have seen him. Oh, tell me where to find
him!” and taking the nun’s hand, she pressed it to
her lips.</p>

<p>Sister Marie shivered slightly; she had not had
time yet to forget. The Reverend Mother answered
for her.</p>

<p>“He is alive, my child; but where he lodges we do
not know, only there is one who does. We will enquire
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” exclaimed Loïs. “Oh, Reverend
Mother, I have waited so many to-morrows! I am
not weary; let me go to him to-night. And the
child?”</p>

<p>“Is at rest; him you cannot find,” said Sister Marie
Mercèdes. “But your brother is in Quebec,” she continued.
“Madame Péan, in the Rue St. Louis, will tell
you where to find him. You must go to her to-night;
to-morrow she leaves Quebec.”</p>

<p>“Thank God I am in time,” said Loïs, and bending
her head in token of farewell, she went towards the
door. Bob rose and followed her. But suddenly her
strength seemed to fail her, and she staggered; Sister
Marie Mercèdes was beside her.</p>

<p>“Lean on me,” she said gently, and placing her in
a chair, she held some water to her lips. Loïs drank
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Are you in want of food?” asked the Reverend
Mother.</p>

<p>“We have travelled all day,” said Loïs faintly; and
hardly knowing that she did so, she let her head rest
on Sister Marie’s bosom. Once more the Reverend
Mother rang her bell.</p>

<p>“See if there be some hot soup in the kitchen, and
send Michel here,” she said to the serving sister.
Then, going up to Loïs, she added, “We will do what
we can for you, my child. What food we have you
are welcome to, and I will send Michel to find out
where your brother lodges. It is snowing fast; you
cannot wander to and fro in the streets of Quebec
to-night.”</p>

<p>An hour later, warmed and comforted, Loïs rose to
depart. Michel was to conduct her to the address
which Madame Péan had given.</p>

<p>“May I kiss you?” said Loïs, holding the young
nun’s hand in hers; and not doubting what the answer
would be, she kissed her in the old French-Canadian
fashion, on both cheeks. “Farewell, Madame,” she
said, turning towards the Reverend Mother.</p>

<p>“God bless thee, my daughter. It grieves my heart
to send you forth on such a night; but you would not
rest even if I sought to detain you, therefore go in
peace. Michel will see you safely to your journey’s
end!”</p>

<p>And so once more, with the snow whitening her
black cloak and the Indian lad’s bearskin, and followed
by Bob, Loïs went forth. Surely she was nearing the
end!</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>“Roger, do you not hear some one knocking at the
outer door? I could almost think I heard old Bob
bark. There it is again.” And truly a dog’s sharp
imperative bark rose loud and clear on the still night
air.</p>

<p>Without answering, Roger rose, left the room, and
opened the front door, which led out into the street.
He was almost thrown backwards by the sudden rush
of the big wolf-hound, which sprang upon him with
a bark of recognition, and then bounded past. He
was followed by two figures, and then the door was
quickly pushed back to keep out the snow which came
drifting in.</p>

<p>“Roger!” and Loïs, throwing back her hood, stood
before him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Loïs, my darling!”</p>

<p>In the unexpected joy of that moment, the strong
man’s pride gave way; the love which had been so long
kept in check rose all powerful, and without uttering
a word more, he gathered her in his arms and held her
in a passionate embrace.</p>

<p>“Who is it? What has happened?” said Charles,
coming out, the dog leaping round him.</p>

<p>“Look!” said Roger proudly, his voice trembling
with emotion, as, still encircling Loïs with his arm, he
almost carried her into the sitting-room, and, placing
her in the armchair Charles had vacated, began loosening
her cloak.</p>

<p>In that second of time the man’s face had utterly
changed. His youth seemed to have come back to
him; the smile on his lips, the light in his eye, shone
down upon Loïs until she could hardly bear it, and,
closing her eyes, the tears rolled down her face. It
was more than she had dared hope for. Together!
she had found them together, and it was as if all her
strength forsook her with the accomplished task. She
who had been so brave broke down now; she had no
longer any need for strength. The touch of his hand,
the few caressing words which escaped him, told her
that from henceforth the burden of life was lifted
from her shoulders, that the great harmony of
perfect love for which she had so patiently waited was
hers at last.</p>

<p>“Oh, Roger!” she repeated, and her arms were
round his neck, her head upon his shoulder, and, as
if the floodgates of her soul had opened, her sobs filled
the room. Truly the clouds had broken at last, and even
as she wept she saw the rift and the blue sky shining
forth, and she knew that the light of a new day was
dawning for her and for Roger.</p>

<p>“Well, Loïs, have you no word for me?” said Charles
reproachfully.</p>

<p>She sprang up, exclaiming,&#8212;</p>

<p>“My dear brother, forgive me. I came to find you
and take you home.”</p>

<p>“And instead of one you have found two,” said
Charles, kissing her. “My brave sister, you deserve
to be rewarded after such a quest. We will all go
home together. Surely if you came through the snow
alone with Jim, we can return the same way. What do
you say, Roger?”</p>

<p>“As soon as your strength permits it we will go,”
answered Roger. “I saw that Madame who came here
yesterday again this morning, and she promised to
send me the passes necessary for us to get through
that part of the country still held by the French; once
we receive them we can start&#8212;at least, as soon as you
feel strong enough.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall not be here much longer,” said
Charles. “The sight of Loïs seems to have given me
back my strength. We must be home for Christmas.
Jim, good Jim,” he said, patting the Indian boy’s head,
as he crouched before the fire.</p>

<p>“I called him Jim when he was quite a little chap,”
said Charles. “He has run my commissions ever since
he was able to run at all. You’ll stay with us always
now, Jim? After this last exploit of bringing Loïs up
to Quebec we can’t part with you.”</p>

<p>“Jim never leave you, Nosa,”<sup>[8]</sup>  answered the lad,
raising his eyes, full of a dog-like devotion, to Charles’
face.</p>

<p class='fn'>[Footnote 8: Father&#8212;Master.]</p>

<p>“That is well. We will all go home together.”</p>

<p>For the first time in her life Loïs knew what it was
to be made much of, to be cared for and thought for;
she who had always cared for others. They remained
a week in Quebec, during which time Charles regained
his strength with marvellous rapidity. It seemed
almost as if Loïs had brought the breath of life with
her from the old home. During that week Loïs visited
the battle-field on the Plains of Abraham, and all the
spots which from henceforth would be landmarks in
the history of Quebec. Roger was, moreover, busy
making preparations for the homeward journey; sleighs
were bought, strong horses to draw them, furs to wrap
themselves in, and a goodly store of provisions for the
journey. They were not going alone; besides his two
faithful servants, a company of Roger’s Rangers volunteered
to accompany them; so that when they started
from Quebec they mustered about a score of souls.
Loïs was like a queen amongst them. General Levis
had sent them free passes through the French lines,
so that no difficulties arose to impede their rapid
progress.</p>

<p>The land was icebound, the cold intense, but the
weather brilliant. Down the great St. Lawrence they
went; across country, as only men born in the land
and knowing every inch of the ground they traversed
could have done. Home, home, was the watchword,
before which every hardship seemed of no account.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>“Father Nat! mother! here they are coming up the
hill!” and Susie dashed into the kitchen.</p>

<p>No need to say who were coming.</p>

<p>“Oh, my lads, my lads!” cried Father Nat, and bareheaded
as he was, he strode out through the garden
into the high road, and stood with his arms stretched
out to welcome the children home.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>From far and near, from villages and lonely farmhouses,
in sleighs, on foot, by land in the most
primitive conveyances, skating along the icebound
lakes and rivers, the people came flocking to Marshwood
to celebrate Roger the Ranger’s and Loïs Langlade’s
wedding-day.</p>

<p>Never in the memory of man had such a Christmas
Eve been witnessed. Brightly the sun shone on the
glistening snow, as the bride in her sleigh, decorated
with holly and evergreens, with white bearskins
wrapping her round, was driven by Father Nat himself
down to the village church, amid the shouts and joy-wishes
of the crowd lining the hill-side and the long
village street. Roger’s Rangers had mustered in full
force to do their Captain honour, and very gay they
looked in their red shirts and tan gaiters as they filed
into the church after the bridal party.</p>

<p>There were few dry eyes in that assembly as the old
minister rose to address them, and in simple, strong
words reminded them of the dark days and the sorrows
through which they had all passed. He spoke of the
noble examples which had been set to them by men
such as Wolfe and Howe, and others whose nameless
graves were not without due honour. “And surely,”
he added in conclusion, “we New Englanders are more
than ever bound to bring up our children in the true
faith, free men, lovers of that liberty for which so
many have bled, remembering always that the lives of
great men are landmarks, pointing those that come
after to like deeds of high honour, not of idle acquiescence
in the past, but to be up and doing, regenerating
the earth by love, peace, and goodwill, even as the
Christ, whose birthday we shall celebrate to-morrow,
brought peace and goodwill to man.”</p>

<p>The merry-making lasted a whole week, and many
of those who had come from afar lingered still longer.
Amongst the number were William Parkmann and his
young wife, and with them they had brought a sister
of the former, Elizabeth Parkmann, who took so kindly
to the homely life of the Marshes, and more especially
to the master of Alpha Marsh, that Father Nat, radiant
with joy, said to John Cleveland, as they sat together
in the chimney corner, “We shall see Marcus in the
pulpit yet, and Charles and Roger reigning in my
stead.”</p>

<p>“Amen, so be it!” answered the minister.</p>

</h2>


<p>Six days after the battle on the Plains of Abraham,
General Levis appeared before Quebec, to find that
the fortress had capitulated. His indignation knew no
bounds. He had been educated in General Montcalm’s
school, and would not recognise that France was
defeated. With a handful of about three thousand
men, the remnant of the French army, he retired at
first to Jacques Cartier, and afterwards to Montreal,
and coolly decided that he would continue the war
and re-conquer Quebec. Of such stuff heroes are
made. They do not know when they are vanquished!</p>

<p>In the month of April 1760, two French ships, the
<i>Atalanta</i> and <i>Pomona</i>, having on board ammunition
and the necessary siege materials, slowly descended
the St. Lawrence, profiting by a narrow channel which
a sudden thaw had opened out right through the
middle of the river. The troops, consisting of three
thousand regulars and two thousand Canadians and
savages, marched with great difficulty through the
half-melted snow, until one morning they reached that
very Plain of Abraham where Wolfe and Montcalm had
fought their mortal duel.</p>

<p>General Murray, Governor of Quebec, immediately
ordered a sortie, and offered battle to the little French
army. He had at his command four or five thousand
men and twenty-two pieces of artillery.</p>

<p>It was the 28th of April, 1760.</p>

<p>The assault of the French was terrific, the very
impetus of despair. The Canadians charged, having
fastened knives into the ends of their guns to supply
the want of bayonets. The English artillery mowed
down their ranks, but still they advanced with drums
beating furiously to the charge. To repair their defeat,
to die or to conquer, that was their sole object, and,
thus animated, they threw themselves on the English
with such fury that they forced them to retreat, and
take refuge in Quebec; but not before they had left
twelve hundred dead upon that fatal field. The French
themselves had their brave general, Bourlamaque,
severely wounded, and lost eight hundred men, the
whole corps of Grenadiers!</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, General Levis laid siege to Quebec.
The cannon which had been taken from the English
served him well, but he lacked ammunition.</p>

<p>“If only one ship would come from France to our
assistance before the English fleet arrives, Quebec would
once more be ours, and the white lilies of France would
float from her ramparts,” exclaimed General Levis,
gazing out to sea, watching with the yearning of his
heroic heart for the succour which would restore his
lost prestige.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of the 15th of May when in
the distant horizon sails were visible. Besieged and
besiegers alike strained their eyes to recognise from
whence they came. Were they English or French
ships? It is easy to conceive the agonising suspense
which filled every heart. The English historian and
eye-witness, Knox, has graphically described it as
follows:&#8212;</p>

<p>“We stood gazing for some time up the river in an
inexpressible state of anxiety, until the sails became
clearly visible, and we knew they were the advance
ships of the English fleet! It is impossible to describe
the scene which followed. Men and officers leapt on to
the ramparts facing the French army, and, waving
their hats, gave vent for upwards of an hour to
hurrahs and shouts of delight. We had suffered
much during the siege, and our deliverance was therefore
doubly welcome.”</p>

<p>The news was greeted in England with almost equal
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Happy, happy day!” wrote Pitt. “My joy and
satisfaction are beyond all expression.”</p>

<p>But still, though forced to raise the siege, having
lost their two solitary ships, and obliged to retire once
more to Montreal, the remaining handful of French
soldiers and Canadians would not yield. Under the
influence of a fixed idea these last defenders of Canada
seemed literally to have gone mad. Three English
armies of forty thousand men surrounded General
Levis and his three thousand six hundred soldiers who
had taken refuge in Montreal. Montreal was an open
town, having round it only a low wall, originally
intended to defend it from the attacks of the savages.
Of course all idea of defence was impossible. Vaudreuil
consented therefore to capitulate.</p>

<p>But Levis, indignant at a clause in the capitulation
in which General Amherst refused the honours of war
to his heroic troops, would not lay down his sword,
and retired with two thousand men to the Island of
St. Helen; and only upon the Governor Vaudreuil’s
formal command did he at last yield, and laid down
his arms on September 8th, 1760, protesting to the
last against the treatment of the French troops, who,
he declared, “merited more attention from Monsieur
de Vaudreuil, and more esteem from General Amherst.”</p>

<p>Thus this terrible war, which had caused such a
fearful sacrifice of human life, and such great suffering,
was over. The unhappy French soldiers were sent on
board English ships, and, in the midst of one of the
most terrific storms on record, bade adieu to the land
they had fought so bravely to retain for their own.
But they left behind them a reputation which, as time
goes on, and events are seen through the halo of the
past, grows in magnitude. England herself glories in
having vanquished such almost unconquerable defenders
of the soil; and their beloved General Montcalm lies
in no unhonoured grave. In raising a monument to
their own victorious Hero, the conquerors did not forget
the great <i>vanquished Hero</i>. Side by side they stand
in the fair city of Quebec, telling of noble deeds and
spotless fame&#8212;“Wolfe and Montcalm. With courage
they faced death. History has united them in glory,
and Posterity has erected this monument to their
memory.” A noble epitaph, for noble men!</p>
